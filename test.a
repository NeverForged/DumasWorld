years ago , in la , i turned a trick on sunset and western . the guy was polite and didn't argue about the price . he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with . a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room . there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room . the room had a bed and a dresser . he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him . about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up . i felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes , but he said it was all right and began dressing . when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and ... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek . he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car . i remember being relieved that i wouldn't have to work again that evening . $ last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized . there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg . the girl must have been taking a break between customers . it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there , loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and ... the reason i'm telling you this epilogue is that i felt that i'd come full circle . $ where was that house ? the one in la , i mean .

okay . so what does ' just over the street ' mean - - give it to me in yards . $ eighteen yards . that's my house there . $ would you like a cup of tea before you go ?
yes .
mrs . thorwald ?
huh huh huh . that was cool . $ no it wasn't ! $ nnnnooo . oooooh nooooo .
shields activated !
so what did you think ?
leave me alone . $ you're comfortable . this is a life of convenience for you , and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself .
you may go , mr . kringelein . $ does the world belong to you , mr . preysing ? $ what is this insolence ?
you've said that enough ! ... maybe lucy's dead ... maybe they're both dead ... but if i hear it from you again , i'll fight ya , mr . edwards ! $ that'll be the day ! ... let's ride .
you got something to say about the mobile infantery ? $ you heard me . wanna make something out of it , private ? $ not with an officer , no , sir . the m . i . doesn't mint stupid cap troopers .
what's happened ? $ i'm all right , mr . leland . only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me . i learned ' em ! didn't i , officer ? $ if you hadn't come along and protected me when you did , i'd have killed them fellows .
i figured , whenever you decided to go , you'd be all set . $ how thoughtful of you . and what if i decide not to go ? $ i don't know any other way , annie .
if that were true , i would not be here . $ it's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants .
you know what i think ? i think our luck has just about run shit out ... $ a little to the left ...
about that chest-cutter ...
oh i know that . how does it go ... $ you know , darling you ... you send me ... darling you ... you mend me . honey , sing it for judge tower .
yeah , we promise . $ well , there's my boys . shit . i gotta go . looks like i caused a ruckus with that shot . half the damn neighborhood is comin ' .
so i do it . $ no you don't , and you know it . $ if our positions were reversed , would you leave me ?
yeah , well ... nobody's perfect . they couldn't go doing everything at once .
nice set of conrads you have out there , mrs . schuyler . i was just glancing through this one . what's michael tearing the paper about ? $ just a habit . mr . schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around . $ rumors ? rumors ? since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor ?
i'm not exactly sure ... it looks close . did we pass an abandoned school bus yet ? $ i don't know . $ come on , we need something like this . it could be the real deal . it's too far out of the way to come back to .
i know where he is . $ and why should we believe you ?
very little .
a report ? $ a police report .
and , nothing . they checked out just fine .
oh , i know all that . sometimes i wish i was back in that garage ...
would you like me to leave ... ? is this a bad time - - ? $ what ... ?
he won't go into the interrogation room . $ someplace else , then .
i'm still here .
it's your fantasy ...
does the threat board show anything ? $ well , that's the funny part of it , too , sir . it doesn't show a damned thing .
why's that ? $ he said he knew how to protect us . but he didn't know anything . he made us think it was over and done with . $ what is ?
you fool - - look around you ! this planet is destroying itself !
well , no , not exactly . it's a complicated case , maude . lotta ins . lotta outs . and a lotta strands to keep in my head , man . lotta strands in old duder's - - $ do you still have that doctor's number ? $ huh ? no , really , i don't even have the bruise any more , i - -
you look better than ever .
jesus . how much ... how much will the whole thing cost ? $ hard to say . if we go for custody , depositions , psychiatric evaluations , it could drag on . ten or twelve thousand dollars . she could win on appeal . if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn , assuming they're unduly restrictive , it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred . $ oh .
say--wait a minute ! $ see you later , shortie--i'm off to the pool .
what did he say ?
we're about ready to go here . are you ready ? $ let's do it . $ so , mickey , tell us what you do for fun .
* thank you . * $ fuck you ; i gave you a reason to live and * you were more than happy to help . you lie * to yourself ! you don't want the truth , * the truth is a fucking coward . so you * make up your own truth . * $ beg my forgiveness ! beg my wife's forgiveness before i blow your brains out !
we're really sorry , but it wasn't our fault .
what was her name ?
if only you'd remained true to our contract ! opiates , for his nerves ! restraints ! the man warrants a bed of nails - -
you just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie . i don't understand . what's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies ? $ you'll never understand . me and you , wayne , we're not even the same species . i used to be you ... then i evolved . from where you're standing , you're a man . from where i'm standing , you're a ape . i'm here ... i'm right here ... and you ... you're somewhere else , man . you say why ? i say why not ? $ tell me about the purity .
they don't know this . $ and you're going to educate them ? tell me something , you're so smart how come you spent eight years at m . i . t . to become a cable repairman ? $ dad ...
you and regan ? $ you and us . $ did you do that ?
yeah , well , it's not a point of view that a . t . f . shares . once we make it evidence , it belongs to us . you are now officially out of trouble . don't do nothing stupid , now .
not all that pasta . $ fine . $ like japanese food .
yes , gaston ?
what ? $ i wasn't expecting this . i need to think .
not stargher , not really . he's split himself right down the middle . good / evil , right / wrong , merciful / cruel . a monster . and an innocent child . if i could reach the boy . $ whoa . hold on . aren't they the same guy ?
we'll ground her , clip her wings a bit . school and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice . this has to be handled delicately . dan kelly , in the district attorney's office , will probably help us out , quietly . christ , this could be embarrassing . $ honey , this is difficult , but we've all had our moments . i tried - -
... pardon ? $ ... i said , i like your hair . $ ... thank you .
how soon - - $ we encoded four minutes - -
what the fuck is going on here ? ! you can't install a simple goddamn double implant ? ! $ it's not my fault . we hit a memory cap .
what care the bones when the soul is free ?
i only saw theo drive up . $ who's watts ? $ the children . the children hugh crain built the house for . the children he never had .
gonna fuck that up too . i should sue her ass . only reason i won't is to protect christine . $ that's thoughtful . $ so how did stephanie know it was saturday ? we didn't get into that with gary .
how do i know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever , you're not going to run around on me ? if we're going to be together i have to be able to trust you .
where will my bed be , where will i sleep ? $ at your mom's . she'll have a bed for you in your own room .
you're breaking my ribs ! $ what ?
does it hurt ?
it's siesta .
... something like that . yeah .
what's wrong ?
okay . you read me well enough . why can't i read you ? $ don't bother $ dodge ... he's not like me at all . but he makes sense . held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew . i understand why he's here . but you ... you're no seeker . you're negative .
do we have to talk about this ?
shut up ! ! ! $ plenty of room for two people .
maybe it won't stay in . $ maybe you better just drive me home . $ let me just ask you a serious question first .
don't you have a real story to write ? why aren't you in latin america ? $ this is the story .
you don't believe it was a car accident .
that's cop bullshit .
my name goes on that report . it's a half-assed job , i don't get my doctorate . neither do you ... $ the shark will get it for us . $ i thought we were planning a long rosy future together .
it's just not enough .
nothing . it's just you're a girl after my own heart .
she was so great , why'd you leave her ?
she's been stalking you , peter .
would you check out my studio some time ?
how do you want that cooked ?
right ... that's ... er ... that's nice of you , terri . can i ask ? is it always this ... exploratory ? $ ha ! i don't know yet . first time . kitchen virgin , that's me .
thanks just the same .
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you , and you didn't get scared - -
what happens to them ? $ they fuck like minks , raise rugrats , and live happily ever after . $ it won't sell .
psychiatrist said i was the healthiest person he'd ever met , so marty fired him .
oh , well . i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite . when he comes out , you tell him i'll be back . he hasn't gotten rid of me ! $ all right .
... is that all you want ... ? ... to watch me ... ? $ yes . it's very good , eve . $ chauncey ! chauncey !
it is to me too . $ you remind me of someone . you from the west coast ?
what did he say ?
well , ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in france ... the man's french , isn't he ?
yeah , someone spotted two of ' em in this hobo camp out by the airport , called the number - -
to friends . $ yes , anatoly , yes .
mr . hunsecker , you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels . $ you hear that , susie ... continue please ...
please .
then who killed the president ? $ oh man , why don't you stop . this is too fuckin ' big for you ! who did kennedy ? it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma . even the shooters don't fuckin ' know ! don't you get it yet ? i can't be talking like this . they're gonna kill me . i'm gonna die ! i don't know what happened . all i wanted in the world was to be a catholic priest - live in a monastery , study ancient latin manuscripts , pray , serve god . but i had this one terrible , fatal weakness . they defrocked me . and then i started to lose everything . $ shit ! forgot to glue this fuckin ' rug today . you know , at one time i even had a full head of hair like everyone else . and then i lost that . that fuckin ' clay shaw . i hate the bastard . all i got left is in his rotten , bloody hands . he tipped the newspapers - i know it . that's how the agency works . they use people , chew them up , spit ' em out . now it's my turn .
i think you'd better sit down . $ tucker , i appreciate you doing all this , but i'm really strapped for time here and - - $ mary , the man's a killer .
you're asking for somebody else ? $ it happens to be a matter of life and death .
with your mother's pull , how come you're not a chicken colonel by now ?
yes , baby ? $ there's dad , on tv .
of course not . they're possibles . i've checked them against bureau records , check them against your file . how did you get it ? $ daitz hinted it existed . it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms . $ after my hiatus , after i got my priorities readjusted , i drifted online , started tracking porn chat rooms , looking for zero . got accepted , came across these boys swapping stories , pictures , downloads . never found zero , but i did come across some class a scumbags .

by definition you're lying to ann , too .
yeah , you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you , you'd probably kill it .
we can't wait to be sure . $ i don't want to move again ... i like it here .
... gardiner is laconic , matter-of fact . the scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american . but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man , we're going to need facts on his background ...  ... kinney , what did you come up with ? $ ... nothing . $ ... skip the levity , kinney - what have you got ?

my dear princess , the human soul is a highly elusive commodity . i suggest you spend some hours before the glass . contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul . $ you're a beast ! $ what was that ? did you hear that ?

you're bluffing , you bastard !
his mother ? $ yeah , i guess he still lives with her . seemed like a sweet lady - - got diabetes or something - - so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to providence .
this way , madame . are you alone ? by the window perhaps ? or a nice little corner table ?

i was wondering ... do you have dinner plans ?
the monkey , of course . it was his idea .
this is a neurelyser . it was a gift from some friends from out of town . i need you to look at it . this red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain . more specifically , the ones - for memory , which it will then block . i said i need you to look right here . $ why ? what are you gonna do ? $ underground gas vein . next time , be more careful when you shoot off your guns .

i * helped * you not to think about wally . you were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him , about his being killed and not coming back - - but when you were with me , you could stop worrying ... well , for a while , anyway . this is how i helped you , right ?
i gotta go .
we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor . $ you know something ? you should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ? $ have no idea what ordinary people thought .

they range up to three thousand .
you should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it . you forgot or what ? you could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine , plus two years in prison . now you want to talk to us about it , or you want to talk to customs ?
this is where it happened . right over here . $ yeah , i know .
once upon a time there was a rich king ...  ... and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in africa . well , one day this king got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold , and before long these bad men come back and - - $ the blue men ? $ just a man . goodnight pearl , sleep tight ; and don't let the bedbugs bite .

he had his palm print on the weapon . $ it went to the goddamn fbi and they didn't find a goddamn thing . it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could've taken off oswald at the morgue . there's no chain of evidence , bill . and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository ? one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser , described by deputy weitzman ... maybe , just maybe , lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill - " a patsy " . take it at face value . lou , susie , i'm going with my gut here . he's got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle , " o . h . lee " to rent the room , right ? what's in a name , right ? in intelligence , they're assumed to be fake . a name is sort of like a postbox number , a code - several different people can use the same name , right ? then why can't somebody be using oswald's name ?
so old elaine robinson got started in a ford . $ don't talk about elaine .

i think what you fear martin is domesticity . it's the greatest fear that men have who belong to western culture . it's centuries old . like king phillip , in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought , " well , wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought ... oh ... the saracens . " so he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families . $ so you're saying that ulysses - - everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie ? he just wanted to fuck around ?

yeah , i read the report ... $ hey , the bastard's got my gun . i want it back . $ jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian ... in other words , we can't seen like we're in the revenge business ... i know , we all know the truth's a little different .
it's very faint but i've isolated it to the third planet in the kolarin system . $ what do we know about the planet ? $ uncharted . we'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan .

but ... where was this man gardiner before last week ? $ apparently the white house shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation , and , according to our sources , neither the f . b . i . nor the c . i . a . has met with success . $ i see . clearly , such interest on their part is of great political significance .
it was after you , baby . after you . $ boy , that sauna is really ... can't you turn it down or something ?
what about carl and catherine ? is he just coaching her , or what ? $ constantly . night and day . and unless i get up before the birds , i can't get in any practice time for myself ... $ uhm hmm .

perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory . mr . o'keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man . he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long . does that bring back memories of willie o'keefe ? $ not at all . but on the other hand , i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other . that is precisely the point of a long dining table . the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it . $ i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps .

i don't know .
my father has a gun at home .
we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor . $ you know something ? you should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?

perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory . mr . o'keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man . he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long . does that bring back memories of willie o'keefe ? $ not at all . but on the other hand , i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other . that is precisely the point of a long dining table . the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it .

he was short but powerful . with hairy arms ? anyway , he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used . we did it there on an old bed . $ ' we ' did it ? whattaya mean ? didn't he force you ? $ well , sure . but he was super-gentle , you know ? i mean , he raped me and all , but i guess there's all different kinds of rapes . i didn't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started , it didn't seem all that terrible . it was over pretty quick , and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off . then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin ' my sandwich .
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure . $ tush , thou art deceived . hast thou no letters to me from the priest ? [ balthsasr shakes his head no . ] no matter . well , juliet , i will lie with thee tonight . i will hence tonight . $ live and be prosperous ; and farewell good fellow .
hopeless . it's hopeless . $ david , let's go now . $ leave me alone , dammit ! you people are crazy ! i've got to get away from here ! i've got to do something !
nothing ... it's just ... i didn't see my father at the ceremony . $ he'll show up . c'mon , what's really wrong ? $ about him ?
well , keep going ! we want an extra out on the streets before it's too late !
a man ? - - to switzerland ? - - that must have been nice - - for him . $ only in mutual advantages - - moreover ... $ moreover ... he was a lucky man - - that man .
that nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something ! that's why moving wit'cha uncle elroy and cousin day-day is the best thing for you right now . $ ya'll making me look like a punk . $ must be your upper lip , ' cause i don't smell nothing .
okay . but what if i'm not in <u> too </u> big a hurry ? what if i take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life ? to smell a flower ? $ that's great . let's do a take .
listen , what i'm about to tell you , i'm telling you in confidence , okay ? have you ever heard of a company called big.com ? $ big.com . that internet thing .
out of the mouths of babes . $ he's insane or drunk or something . why , if this unfortunate man , williams , has really been reprieved , i personally am tickled to death . aren't you , pete ?
that cuthbert . what a piece of work . someone's dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit . $ cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success . the museum is in debt . contributions and public funding have dried up . admissions no longer cover overhead . the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit . cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red . if the superstition exhibit isn't lucrative , he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems . $ i can't help thinking there's something that pendergast overlooked . if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard , it wants something that's in here .
look if you can't think of anything , it doesn't matter . i'll do one . my five favorite from the old days at the dodger . $ oh , i'm sure i can manage something ... " sin city . " " new rose , " by the damned . " hit it and quit it " by funkadelic . " shipbuilding , " elvis costello , japanese import , no horns , or different horns , anyway ... um ... " mystery train " by elvis presley ... and ... " spaced cowboy " by sly and the family stone . a bit controversial , i know , but ... $ fine . that's great .

no , it isn't your fault . the walls here are just so thin .

i - - uh - -
it happens . this is where you'll be sleeping . $ holy cow . $ we'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything , duane will be right outside the door .
at home alone - where were you ?
this is crazy - - $ why ? a man appears at your side , almost never leaves it , you clearly trust him , depend on him , i sense you value him deeply , why aren't those things good enough for me ?
please . i'm not seeing anyone until this is over . one husband at a time . $ i wish i had your discipline . $ i don't know what his game is . he dismissed every one of ruth's proposals . and sarah , we weren't unreasonable .
1944 . the next face , please . $ it's the man who came to the funeral yesterday - - i'm sure of it - - a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie . $ does the name tex penthollow mean anything to you ?

wade's in cryo-prison . $ he could be brought back .
to know about it ? it was a kill squad . black on black . closed down two years ago . nobody wants to know about treadstone . not around here . you better take this back to marty and make sure he knows what you're doing . $ he does . i've been down to the archives . i have the files , ward .

the reason i got the part ... i'm a little like lizzie . except i don't worry about some man rescuing me . $ good thing . $ you got some kind of list ?
then why don't you ask him ? ! ? $ sit down , miss juspeczyk . as i mentioned , the people in this file are all close associates of dr . manhattan . they have something else in common as well . they've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer .
of course not . please . $ well ... heck , this is the first time i ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman ! i'd figure roughly ...  ... your car plus five hundred . $ five hundred .

i got the part on " t . j . hooker " .
i cannot believe you are saying this ? you , who i have relied on all this time - -
verbal , i know you know something . i know you're not telling us everything .
don't mention that word around here . you'll get them excited . $ this is a fucking nightmare . $ right . sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops .
huh huh huh . hey beavis . we're on a bus with chicks . $ heh hmm heh heh . $ check it out butt-head , porta-potties .
which would you rather ... ?
yeah ? $ give this to joey , will you ? $ stay out of it , sefton .
most people just want to make money or be famous or something . but you risk everything , just to help people .

i don't know what else to do . $ help me .

if you admit to making three , then it's four , actually . but how ?
of course they're jews . $ notice the israelis : a fundamentally secular society . they no longer need judaism because they have soil . the real jew is a wanderer , a nomad . he has no roots , no attachments . so he " universalizes " everything . he can't hammer a nail , plow a field . he can only buy and sell , invest capital , manipulate markets . he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books , ideas , numbers . this is his strength ... take the great jewish minds : marx , freud , einstein . what have they given us : communism , infantile sexuality and the atom bomb . in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe , they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare , irrational urges and relativity , a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt . why ? because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread , nothing but nothingness . nothingness without end ...
no , nothing like that . the ottos are what i'd call model citizens . they're regular at town meetings . they give their opinions in a respectful way . they always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers . $ and they loved bear .
she's dead ?

you don't have to keep walking with me . i'm okay from here . $ i don't mind .

let's just slow down for a second ... $ you're worried about recouping the loan . i already told you . $ no , i understand that . what i mean ... what i'm trying to say ... i was actually wondering about ... well , my cut .
let me tell you about hatchet harry . once there was this geezer called smithy robinson who worked for harry . it was rumoured that he was on the take . harry invited smithy round for an explanation . smithy didn't do a very good job . within a minute harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand , which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock . he then proceeded to batter poor smithy to death with this ; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . hence , hatchet harry is a man you pay if you owe .
