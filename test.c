yeah ...	yeah , i read the report ... $ hey , the bastard's got my gun . i want it back . $ jack , come on , there is an official department policy about cop killings . cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian ... in other words , we can't seen like we're in the revenge business ... i know , we all know the truth's a little different .

it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then . i call him smedley . his real name is frankie jenkins - but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering " frankie ! " .. where is this leading to , mr . garrison ?	perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory . mr . o'keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man . he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long . does that bring back memories of willie o'keefe ? $ not at all . but on the other hand , i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other . that is precisely the point of a long dining table . the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it . $ i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps .
that piece of shit . workin ' with the cops .	what's the cut , poppa ? $ juicy , junior , real juicy . $ what the fuck are you talking about ?

there is more to love than he knew , or that you know .	what quaint notions , d'artagnan ! but they contradict my father , who picked his queen when he was old , and only then to bear me .

no .	my father has a gun at home .
have no idea what ordinary people thought .	we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor . $ you know something ? you should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?

dad , when i called the machine to check our messages there was one from bethel baptist . mr . franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back . he said when we come home , if you still feel the same way - -	it's the bitterest of pills . $ you two ought to start a stand-up act , because you're just wasting your humor on me .
if you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system . then , if you move fast enough , stay ahead of ' em ... without bein ' able to signal each other , they might have a hard time catchin ' you .	this stuff really works ? no shit ? $ quicker than gas . and it smells a lot prettier . it usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep .

the truth is , the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public . john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense .	ah , but therein lies the paradox . it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents . the longer she is away , the stronger they become ; and who , honestly , can promise security against that ? however many doors you lock , someone will always get in . even here . $ so ... ?

granted , monsieur .	i am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity ... the fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead , prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon .
yet you look so sad . a great man like you should not be sad .	yes . happy happy .
don't you remember ...	oh yes . why , you told me to sell them a long time ago . $ i'd never tell you to sell those . i bought them for my daughter .
we came here from a solar system on the verge of self - annihilation ... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life . a small group of us set off to find a new home ... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds . that was three hundred and nine years ago .	no , we're here to ... rescue them . $ as you wish . but i would ask you to disarm yourselves . this village is a sanctuary of life .
did you call the police ?	what do you mean ? some noises where ? $ in the house . i was scared .
wait a minute . rowan - what is going on ... ?	what about you coming down here ... ? $ go to lax and get on a flight to new orleans . go to the ponchartrain hotel and wait for me . i'll call you there .
then we're stupid and we'll die .	this is my uncle roy , sebastian . $ hello , glad to meet you .
aren't you off-duty ?	good morning !
i know he does .	i bet he don't . karl likes me .
yeah , i mind . you bet your ass i mind .	i want my fucking money - - $ i'm sorry , i'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here - - do you mind ?
but what about your theory ? the existence of someone like taylor might prove it .	' then how do you account for me ? , $ i don't . and i'm not going to try .
my whales ? where could you take them where they'd be safe ?	where could you take them ? $ hm ?

absolutely .	can i ask you something , mr . henry ?
is it true that you and love went on a blind date ? she hit you with a bottle ?	i think the worst is over . $ it can always get worse . you can't change what's out there , only where you're coming from . you got to let the lord take over , in here . $ she only works when i'm on . i make her wait and it drives her crazy .
how can i serve you in this ?	well ... perhaps you should speak with them , your majesty . $ i have demanded it - - and common priests present themselves ! can you imagine the arrogance ? common jesuit priests try to act as my equals , and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order ! no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can , and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold . even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france ! he suspects the governor general of jesuits , whoever he is , is angling to become pope himself .
front page ?	later . first , i've got some unfinished business . a deal that needs closing ... $ sir , i've always wondered ... why <u> sue </u> ? you could have any woman in the world but - -
