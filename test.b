so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night .
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her . i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in . it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight .
i - - i can't .
not her , the one with the little ...

i know , but she did . she's with someone else now ...
beavis .
at me friend's house .
is that the woman from .. ?
you've had a lot of fun with me today . what would you have done if i hadn't responded to your call ?

no ! why would i want to kill him ?
why do men and women usually see each other ?
say it !
who are you ? hitler's hall monitor ?
i think i can top that , mister ...
sometimes is still hurts . you know how it is , man . i mean , each day you think about it less and less . and then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all , and you almost miss that feeling . it's kinda weird . you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long . and the , boom , something reminds you of her , and you just smile that bittersweet smile .
you afraid you'll have to salute me , chief ?
i know you care about him . i've never seen you like this about anyone , so please don't take it wrong when i tell you that i believe that tom , while a very nice guy , is the devil .

i've heard you call him freddy .
i don't want to take you out of your way .
well ... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds . when they flood the house . that like ... destruction is a form of creation . so the fact that they burn the money is ... ironic . they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart . they want to change things .
it will be okay if i sleep . i need to lie down and sleep .
uh-uh ! not a chance ! there's nobody in this town doing anything with his life , except what his father did , which is nothing . if i can't have more out of life than that , i'd rather be dead !
nothing .
holy shit ... you're dead , man ...
and nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity .

why not ? i must have subjects . it's the only way i can teach . it's the only way you can learn . the stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no - - nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as gray . we can do our own dirty work - - and we must .
she didn't say anything about it to me .
i know , but the joke's better if i tell it in the first person .

this on top of the scratches ... isn't it proof !
so , does " this guy " have a tip for an honest lawyer ?
so was i . the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not .
since lunch .
i don't really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things . my room is right above my father's office . the ear . there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear , and it did come off a living person . that's direct from the coroner's office . the person is unknown . there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on , but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear . i heard some of the same names .
okay , mom . you coming later ? you coming later , george ?
why would they - -
my god , my god ! he talked to the new york times ?
i don't get that . is that sexual ?
hey wait , i paid three bucks for that burger . you owe me ...
oh , sweetheart . it's beautiful !
done like a champion . can you reach me with the line ?
i'm in the movie business .
yes ... we can go forward on this course , but it means going directly through the heart .
oh .
i can do anything i want .
oh , phillip . this cannot be good .
i could have lied i suppose , but i want this marriage to be legal . i just want you to know , i'm trying to start a new life here . i'm depending on your ...
i did all right on mccord .
i know ! i just had to let one go because i couldn't afford him !
set down in there .
what's that ?
i read your teen beat manifesto .
thank you , ben . the garden that i left was such a place . everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands . i planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow .
thank you . thank you very much .
i've heard of a white that big , in australia ...
when i was a kid i identified with that kid , down there alone in that pipe ... a hundred feet down - - doesn't know if they're going to save him .
correct me if i'm wrong , but i don't think so ...
pow .
some people are going out of here . what if i told you where and when ?
she knows arnie metzger .
lovely .
but he's been so patient with me , tatum . you know , with all the sex stuff . how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic ?
short ? it's ended .
i'm sorry , it's just ... i've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and ... sometimes it gets out of hand .
why does she keep repeating the name ?
and get that finger out of your ear . you don't know where that finger's been ! gunderson ?
hold back denver - i'm fine .. you .. you go on upstairs . i'll do the cleaning up .
i was talking about miles .
lost something ?
why me ?
he knows everything .
look , she walked out on her own child , right ? that's desertion , right ? mr . shaunessy , i'm telling you it's an open and shut case .
i know that guy . his hand looks like a paw . an old black guy , the newsstand at - -
reverend mother , on behalf of the sisters , i'd like to welcome mary clarence to st . katherine's .
i know you .
just smile .
like cocoa puffs . good . captain crunch . bad . shreds the roof of your mouth . i mean you hear , " tricks are for kids ! " and you think , " i'm a kid , i guess they're for me . " but your baby brain's got no idea that fruit loops are , like , a million times better . i'm going to save our kid all that pain .
forget it , it'll never work .
right you are , governor !
it'll be too late .
that guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat !
this is me telling you about me .
and you , there are many places to get away . why here ?
all right , miss juspeczyk . pack your things .
and not a sign of the leopard ?
why'd you live there ?
i'm afraid he's pretty worn out , poor kid .
hitch-hiking .
the traffic takes some getting used to .
too late for what ? too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me ? well , you won't do it , i tell you . you won't do it !
gosh , that's a pretty name . buy you a drink ?
hi .
i don't sleep ... theo asked me to pick up his check .
if chewing gum is chewed , the chewer is pursued and in the hoosegow hidden ...
that's it ? no number , or instructions ?
all right . you see that guy over there ? his name is sport . go talk to him . i'll wait here .
just in time .
how immediate is immediately ?
what's this guy's problem ?
they don't suspect <i> him </i> ?
i'd like to see your pictures some day .
i'm sorry i couldn't come up with something more positive .
an oldsmobile silhouette .
i can't tell you . but i'll be back within a week .
a long time , with one man .
then you better do something to * jumpstart that man's motor . you know ... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion .
- - we can't stay here - - i can't stay here - - it's not safe here - -
you do know how to do that , don't you ?
check that ego - come off it - i'm the profit - the proffesor ima teach you ' bout the worm , who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor and he's runnin from the devil , but the debt is always gaining and if he's worth being hurt , he's worth bringin ' pain in - when the sunshine don't work , the good lord bring the rain in .
i can't believe this is happening .
what are you going to do ? you cannot drive them out onto the road . they can stay with me .
have you found dr . bright ?
a deluge doesn't just " happen . " bolts of lightning don't just " happen " ... you burned down an elm tree for christ's sake ...
you think you've been working hard . this muther'll break your back .
... okay .
you haven't looked at the dossier .
none of your fuckin ' business .
what if it catches on fire ?
all right , ginnie , don't get so excited .
i remember us having made some kind of deal , randall . i don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit . i look at you - here - in my town - and i'm confused ...
well , you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself ?
mr . caiman ...
do you want to tell me what you found ?
no , i guess i'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it .
you could have treated us like they did in aspen . no . you wouldn't do a thing like that - - it isn't in you to be mean or cruel .
neither do i . that's where i found it .
anywhere but here . i'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten .
he knew baby suggs ?
i said , someone came last night - - look , this isn't a carnival - - people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules - - everyone signs in and out - - this is a serious place - - serious work - - it's not just to come in whenever you like - -
silver bullets . a collectors item . these are very valuable . they were melted down from a crucifix .
you've decided against the merger ?
i couldn't believe ... did you see the size of that thing's mouth ?
because of kennedy ? are the same people gonna kill us , daddy ?
there is no one .
an ' this ?
i don't know . and you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing . i've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me . you know what , i shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you .
don't give a damn about the famous girl .
i'll discuss what's on my mind when i want to . you're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it .
well , it's not really my job to please . hope you learned something .
i think that you and i are natural enemies .
i gotta tell ya , dave . i've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up . who does these books ?
you've seen her ! ... she's alive ?
that's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet .
what'd you do ?
are you pregnant ? estas embarazada ?
yeah , but satisfaction brought him back . can i ?
we're on a truncated time-table . take a day to shop it ; a day to prep it ... and we're still going to need to expand the crew ...
he's very pleased with your response to the surroundings .
no , sir .
i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons !
boone . clayton boone .
i know .
and i'm gonna finish my drink . and , i'm gonna have a good time , because i ain't doing nothing wrong .

nothing .
shit . i dunno . how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh ?
right here , ben .
yes , for expenses and such . now , you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go . you each have been given an extra battery , so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned . am i making myself abundantly clear ?
sometimes you got a big ugly mouth .
sure as gravity . i've had a feeling about you from the start , cage . it's nausea .
terrific ! you <u> should </u> feel insignificant !
hey , captain god !
i'd say that's a pretty good assumption .
no room there . we'll have to set it between us .
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
you phoned up art esparza's wife ?
i want to work today , that's why i came ...
call me back in ten .
hey , one miracle at a time . they're on to me now , remember ?
we could come to my room .

rizzo , pull away !
they're coming in now .
well , i'm going to be working here , mostly at night ; i'm a writer . do you have room service ?
can you handle the door gun ?
say , that's pretty good , young man .
dude , i'm not supposed to make calls - -
well , when you're used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges , everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison .
general schmuck , we monitored a trans - mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base , hq 843rd wing . it was apparently directed to their wing on air - borne alert . it decoded as - wing attack , plan-r .

assuming we can trust joe , how we gonna get in touch with him ? he's supposed to be here , but he ain't , which is making me nervous about being here . even if joe is on the up and up , he's probably not gonna be that happy with us . joe planned a robbery , but he's got a blood bath on his hands now . dead cops , dead robbers , dead civilians ... jesus christ ! i tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight . if i was him , i'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible .

shut up . cuff him to the rail .
if he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us .
i'm sorry , elle , i just - -
what ? no , i'm was worried that ... i was just wondering what's taking so long .
we can always do that , duff .
walter ?
oh , god , dj , what do i ... how do i ...
last one down springs for room service .
i didn't say what time the assault occurred .
i'm like a bad penny . i always turn up .
what ? where ? !
how old am i ?
just that it's been a perfect day and that i'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this .
go ahead .
they invited me to the xmas party . who knew ?
something must've scared them .
aw come on , it was the only thing to do . he knew he was holdin ' ya back .
i hope the best for you , miss dwiggins , with your school and your paper and all .
and the father replies ?
good one ! thanks .
miss blue blood ? her family's been here since the year 12 .

what happened , ted ? what went wrong ?
yes .
so , bill , if i understand this right , you currently have your penthouse floor under construction ?
yeah ? what do you do now ?
jack ...
it's not gonna be easy . your brothers can possess people . so they probably won't look like themselves . you have to be suspicious of everyone .
yeah , i know .
but , after all , you have yours .
from the magazine ?
if you guys are right , if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow , i think i could win the nobel prize .
shit .
i committed no war crimes .

it shouldn't have . but it did .
haven't you ever seen , like david niven ? you know tiptoe in , tiptoe out .
i dove back into work , everything was fine . until the lesions started ...
yes . unfortunately it's bullshit . the real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors .
this is his state . his uncle's chief judge . his brother-in-law runs the county commission . i don't know how many other relatives he's got in town . there's gotta be a way to work him back in .
that one's an elm .
what is the five grand ? what is the , you said that we were going to split five ...
i'm about to blow the wall .
you don't have time . not a chance .
i know a guy .
something like that . but i'm sorry it ended like this - - tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail .
free to try and find a game
god saw to it to put you in my path . and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness .
sure , but you was worried too , mother ; takin ' off with never a word of goodbye . i even got to figurin ' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of ' em .
i can't help it ...
oh yeah ?
- - the passion in your heart - -
any of us ?
i also answer to whistles .
mister robinson , i fought with captain marion in the french and indian war , including the wilderness campaign . we served as scouts under washington and i have no doubts about captain marion's courage or competence on a battlefield . there's not a man in this room , or anywhere , for that matter , to whom i would more willingly trust my life .
what ?
she isn't that old .
almost done . a week or ten days , and i'll be there .
look , you dont understand . i woke up here ... and this is very strange ... this is not my house ...
i swear to you i wouldn't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case ...

you couldn't have known - -
now go get molly . your friends are going to be here any minute .

it's just a regular day .
oh yeah . there's just one thing i don't get . " monkeybone creator awakens from coma " that's a big story ! that's front page news ! but i can't find a <u> word </u> of coverage in this stinkin ' rag ! <i> </i> hey . don't i have a tv show ?
i know ! you can't imagine how surprised i was . who would think you could find anything divine on the upper east side .
i don't want to be safe . i want to be with you .
we're on fire !
i'm not sure what to believe anymore , young lady . you never used to lie to me . but lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong .
hands off the suit , monkey-boy . close your eyes if you're scared .
where ?
i don't know . it doesn't even matter anymore . i just want you to be happy ... it's not that i don't love you either . but jimmy , your timing couldn't be worse .
what's it look like to you ?
sorry to disappoint . i'm on painkillers for the injury - - they cloud the mind . you're right , it was nunez . any more questions ?
no . no one special .
oh no , sir . some people are natural putterers . others can never master it .
you can have anything you want .
i promised iran to townsend .
yes . she's pretty rested up .
i can't be .
hey , smart-ass , i'm up here right now in a ... luxury alpine retreat , with a two million dollar view of the lake .
done .
i am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel . perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us .
aaaaaaaaaa !
well , it's a complicated issue - -
what's wrong ?
don't move , you bitch ... !
ok . say what it is .
no matter how often i see guns , i still can't get used to them .
sill ? what else would i be working with ?
oh , you know ... don't fuck this up . i'll kill you . i'll kill your family . i'll shoot your dog ... all the usual . then he said good luck .
time's up ... we'll have to take them out immediately .

you're both with the mountain rescue team ?
suzette will be back here any minute .
i didn't sell nothing ! i didn't sell nothing ! i just carried the drugs from the chief to sam .
it's not bad , but it's bad enough . it's a lot worse for my father . i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world .
home school . til today .
look , this is a bad time ...
i'm sorry .
and when i finally agree to spread my legs , you accuse me of treating you like meat .
we were talking one time , drinking rum . i may've mentioned adele , how she worked for a magician . chino got interested . he's like , yeah ? how does he saw the woman in half ? he wanted to meet her . or get a look at her if she ever came to visit .
yes ?
and ... ?
i can't have them any more .
you don't think - - ?
victor , are you feeling alright ?
you may still . somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise .
till it's not funny any more . what do you want , jack ?
far out .
could be suicidal . it's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs .
that does it ...
girl , give it up ! we been friends too long to act like this .
o-o-o-okay , lee . okay , okay . you , you , y-you've said enough . it's my responsibility now . i will work things out .

one of the printers .
weaver , they're career girls . they're obsessed with digging . no , i'll probably never meet the girl for me .
they switched us over .
it's okay , they're training me on the cash register and after i hope to work on one of the jewellery counters .
now listen , it's hands off billy . i mean , you can put your hands on him if you want to , but then my hands will break yours .

there must be an answer somewhere .
what's going on , harry ?
shhh ... car thieves are your weakness .

the girl , lestat -
no one wants another failure right now , god knows . but people like arnold and , god knows , i'm having my fears about general washington .

"
what's more likely , they got in the room and was just panicked , that's all .
okay . so what ? stop worrying . i've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway - -
don't be pissed . i'm on your side , pard . i just don't want you to do something you'll regret . you gotta give six years to the navy if you wanna fly ... that's six years with the most uptight assholes god put on this earth . officers aren't like you and me , man . it's another breed .
i don't think so .
you ought to get some new ties , stewart .
they went that way .
you think so , frankie ?
but i'm not coming to you out of deep conviction , i'm coming to you out of loss . i no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good .
i want you to do something for me .

you could be something . i've got an idea , gallagher . let's get this set . that's a great idea for a play . pal , get me a cigarette , will you ?
it's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets . that voicebox of yours is a hoot . say " i'm wearing no underwear " - - it'll be funny .. you do know you're evil , don't you ?
what was it , roswell ? you had the space ship , the bodies , everything locked up in a bunker , the what is it , area fifty one . that's it ! area fifty one . you knew and you didn't do nothing !
i have no idea what i'm doing .

nothing would please me more .
i'll see you at national .
i don't know .
" ... your wife . "
pop ! that was my card !
" attempted . " at-tempt-ted ! i'm not happy about having to steal that horse , but i do have my pride . face it , when it comes to burglary , and sex , i ...

they're trying to make me spend the summer here . i'm leaving in the morning .
it says jade fox is hiding at yu's . on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yu's . were you involved ?
beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot .
house .
and there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it ?
well , you got your circulation . now , why don't you let me alone ?
what do you think ?
i can imagine . you said you wanted nothing to do with this . you swore to me . " don't come near me . don't bring this into my life ... "
aunt edith . how did she ... die ?
when you wanted to run away , i called your dad .
burn it to a fine ash .
dickie did it .
you couldn't be . look , barry . there's going to be people from laura's work there , people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums . how are you going to cope with them ?
i am not asking for alms , but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart .
lasher will act , rowan . whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it . facing him alone ... i don't like -
sit down and eat . till i say the word , you're doing what you're told .
staring . consequently , when he approached me on his way out i wasn't surprised , but i didn't let on .

so much pain .
no ... it's all right . i got it . don't worry about it .
i may run out of money , but you have already run out of bread . two years is a long time for your comrades to wait .
you tell everyone about sammy . everyone who'll listen . " remember sammy jankis , remember sammy jankis " . great story . gets better every time you tell it . so you lie to yourself to be happy . nothing wrong with that - we all do . who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember ?
i'm getting that way , too .
all except one . he won't have you .
she's been acting weird lately , though . i shoulda seen it coming . babbling on and on and on about " communication " . like i don't know how to communicate .
i'll hate you forever .
no .

simone , i recognize the shirt you're wearing . i gave it to viktor on his birthday .
this isn't difficult , my agent's made dozens of copies . there's gonna be an auction on this , and every publishing house in new york is reading it now . so if you want me to burn it , fine . you're not ridding the world of anything .
it wasn't a date . it was an investigation .
n ... nothing .
well you're not getting , either .
nothing , that's the problem--the story's gone underground .
i was being selfish . and majorly insensitive . and i'm a total idiot .
learning about cuba . having some food .
it was weird ...
listen - - i mean i just saw the needle of the empire state building . you can't see it for the fog !
every time i said it , it was . i never really thought i was going to make it .
everybody on the border knows that story .
i'm telling you , derek , it will sell .
... people who don't mind their own business .
the boys said no . she wouldn't give her name . a month later , the station gets broken into , the file room ransacked .
nice kid .
why can't you be my champion ?
ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it ?

music .
andy , i'm calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry . but - - i need your permission to fire him .
i didn't really think anything of it . no - - i did wonder what he was doing there , but didn't think it had anything to do with us . you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend .
obviously , we'll compensate you for your medical expenses .
a message from citizen fouche .
you see the sign ! it's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time i'm gonna charge you ! $ 2.99 plus one dollar is $ 3.99 !

i heard the drum and fife yesterday , mac , marching past . made my hair stand on end . i thought , i've been asleep for twenty years .
this whole week has gone sour . it isn't turning out like it was supposed to . i want to go home .
what are you going to do ? drink it ?
hello ... ?
you're not seriously considering sending him ?
my palate's kind of shot , but from what i can tell , i'd dub it pretty damn good .
for him ?
you're a horrible person , barry . i mean it .
really ?
you were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks .
how many years did i live with your beams and boards ? first in the garage , then in the living room . we're going to do it , robin . next year . next year . salvaged floorboards from a house in pasadena . doors from a church in new hampshire ...

that's who you were , you don't know who you are .
i admire that , you being true to your wife . i've seen a lot of ... of men ... who weren't .
what about the others ?
shoot it .
who do you like in the opening game , sam ?
yes ... that's what i pray for ... !
will you excuse ...
are you so hungry for traitors ; do you want to find them everywhere ?
and the second rule about it is ... you're not supposed to talk about it . and the third rule ...
" as he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes , the bishop muttered a latin prayer . and then - - with a mighty thrust - - drove it into her very entrails - - "
you said they're destroyed .

yeah . got some business there . what are you gonna do ?
we've got the kid ! we've got your kid ! ! what the fuck is she thinking ? !
oh - - unusual weather we're having , ain't it ?

four complete skeletons . . . . such a small area . . . the same time horizon - -

poor creature ...
<u> never trust the living </u> ! we <u> cannot </u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death .
uh huh .
you have faith , professor barnhardt
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him .
what do you want ? damn it , why isn't there a girl here ? you know this has nothing to do with age . this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies .

listen to me , you thankless little prick . we're your parents , so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully . what the hell is it , this captain ? because i'll see him in a rowboat ...
you know , the elevator man couldn't believe i paid $ 300,000 to have my walls looking like this , he's got them for free in brooklyn .
don't be sorry . help me .
no . rajeev's in india .
it makes sense ; hunt worked for the c . i . a . and the white house was paranoid about teddy kennedy .
i remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg . he limped . don't get me wrong , he's not one of those , you know , limp wrists . he's a butch john . you'd meet him on the street , you'd never snap . you could go fishing with him , play poker with him , you'd never snap in a million years . so one night we were over at ferrie's place . having a party . sometime in the late summer of ' 63 .
so if it ain't staring us in the face , it's got to be retroperitoneal . and that , along with the look of the wounds , makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it .
we see each other every couple of months .
david !

she went back to south africa .
i have a warrant in my pocket that says different .

" she says no . " oh , it was my friend sammy . " she says it wasn't sammy . " oh , i suppose it was my friend lou . " " no , what's the matter , don't you think i have any friends of my own ? ! "

when the enterprise-b beamed us off the lakul , we were partially in the nexus . the transporters locked on to us , but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind .
what use is my sword ? i can't reach her !
terrific , boys . really . terrific .
get it through your head , little girl ; i'm not going for you . if this toby likes you , then if i were you i'd marry him . you're not going to get much better in this town .

i had to beat it before the cops showed up . i don't have a cent to my name . i can't even get my car out of the garage . i tell you , mr . vesci , if it weren't for bad luck i wouldn't have any at all . so , i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car . i'll pay it back with the rest of the money .

- - almost a year before he left the justice department - -
yeah .
you can't do what ?
lady , is it true you're driving without a license ?
that's good ... who ?
oh god brent , is there anything you don't feel guilty about ?
just don't chew it .
did you have sex before you were married ?
during the farpoint mission . we were on the bridge and you told a joke . that was the punchline .
you'd cosmetically alter simone to look like me ?
of course not .
i would say that's a very safe assumption .
it's not that . i mean mouthing off to your teachers . i'll admit ... when dad told me what you said to ms . farmer , i laughed my ass off .
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance ... it's insane , i can't take it anymore .
what is it ?
me ?
what are you talking about ?
an ' she's got a beau ! kisses him , too !
yes . some nut who wanted to kill him . how is your father ?
sure .
and god love you for it .
i was at a cocktail party . very trendy . andrew was in chicago on business . he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling . he looked so helpless .
they're wise by now . which is next , iron springs ? yeah , let's try there , iron springs .
oh , ellen . my sweet ellen ... of course i knew .
all right . okay . i ' 11 ... see you .
would-be . i'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment .
he used a real gun . they should throw his ass in jail .
yeah , but ... you know what i mean .
you think you can take me now ? come on , try .
he shouldn't be telling secrets in bed .
ok . taking golitsyn's exit . jack , open the doors .
if he isn't , then he's stupid .
look at this .
sure , with three days and a blowtorch .
i forgot . anyway , i hate the idea of acting paranoid .
that's because i am the shark .
i'm serious , bruce . we have to - - !
car wash , captain ?
graff ? because i worked for him .
no , she just didn't want me going to jail , that's all .
but , al , it's the bunk ! norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day i met him ! why buzz couldn't have invented it - - look at the man - - he's an imbecile !
you met him . walt waldowski , the dental officer .
it seemed like a possibility . what about your intentions ? are they honorable ?
but it's not totally hopeless for you ... i've had it . i don't even have the energy to try anymore . you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you don't end up like me ...
what kind of doubts ?
what will become of me then ?
i don't think you're old and fat enough for me .
i only have your word for that .
you know what i mean .
yeah , but i didn't do anything .
all right ... shoot ! i mean ... what's on your mind ?
i don't want my wife's soul having any doubts .
show up for what ?
that's right .
i mean , it's there , reggie . if only we could see it . we're looking at it right now .
o . k . and i'm not in love with this fukker ? that's how i feel about him .
oh , i found a key there , all right - - only it's the wrong key .
sorry , brother . i don't know what to tell ya . you know all the girls i been with . you been with ' em too , except for cheryl mcgovern which was a big mistake on your part brother ...
we have to save the world .
oh , walter . i don't deserve you .
no good . i said they disabled the communications system .
that you haven't time for either marriage or eating - -
oh my god , look ! is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh ?
what for ?
oh . eh , i like it .
kelvin , she begged me . i had a short - range version of the destabilizer prototype , a miniature with a range of a few meters . she walked into it and disappeared . she was gone .
and i'll never understand terrorists .
that was money . tell me that wasn't money .
i think the desert is , it's - for a woman - it's very tough , i wonder if it's not too much for her .
what for ? the minute i get him some other gavone will take his place . i've been doing this for twenty years . when i retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs .
ah-ha . well then , we should make some effort to acquire him . we could use a good german composer in vienna , surely ?
i need to do it .
don't you know ?
maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him .
starting with his own .
that's right , homer . this ain't your business .
i'm a cop from new york .
sure .
oh , rubbish ! you have no power here . be gone , before somebody drops a house on you , too .
yeah . two weeks . i didn't get to send you an invitation , but if you ...
when i give an order , you'll not need it interpreted . you have an hour to make your mind up . well , are ye satisfied , mr . mitchell ?
now i can do what i want .
yes , general ?
that there isn't one , as of today . i had my period . i couldn't believe it . he still wanted to marry me .
and - uh - i guess , ' goodnight ' .
kay-em we made it !
did my matzohs come ? get some for everybody . thank you . lemme tell you about my first movie ...
yes i do !
not at all . you have your life . and i have mine .
thanks a lot .
slipped in . probably liked the scent of your perfume .
haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter ?
dan - - what do we do now ?
better than one .
why not ? you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary ? is jean-claude done yet ? *
yes , sir .
i don't believe in fairy tales and hokum , mister o'connell , but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there , the book of the living . it's what first interested me in egypt as a child . it's why i came here , sort of a life's pursuit .
yeah .
bullshit yourself !
well , i understand the problem about the supermarkets , but i was talking to this girl last night , and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset .
you don't know * no * girls around here . you're lyin ' , * you're runnin ' away * !
he wouldn't leave her .
we coulda had ' em for free , all we had to do was give ' em your sister .
no deal .
i'll be there .
my compliments to you , miss stella . this is what i call a saloon .
like even today . i woke up this morning , you know ? and the sun was shining and everything was nice . then the first thing that happens is i see you and i thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up , boy , ' cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing .
the future , marty , the future is everything ! i built this machine to see the future . so i am going to send shemp twenty-four hours into the future . you can assist me , if you like .
[ fantasy time , girls , give it up , give it up . ]
where is he ?
good eye . not one club owner got it . they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card .
and tell her what ?
quite an office - - name on the door - - rug on the floor - - the whole schmear .
you guys are heartless , my bride picked this out .
i know ... wouldn't you be totally pissed off ?
a big hurry , be quick about it - so good night , darling , and sleep tight ...
farewell . god knows when we shall meet again .
am i sure ?
reiben , are you makin ' fun ' a the way i talk ?
open it .
i am the desert , where water disappears - -
so , whyd you say yes to me ?
we've been closed for a while .
why ?
jimmy , come on . fuck ' em . don't give them the satisfaction .
a pretty day's work of it you have made , master roderick . knowing your uncle to be distressed for money , and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family ? best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so . he takes a girl without a penny - - a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past , and missing them all , and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father .
but everything's ok ?
back to san francisco .
why am i out of order ?
between you and me , madam , today the number two .
do i need one ?
if it's about the posters , i think it's so awful . it's a travesty .
yeah ...
really . the california racquet club ?
or , perhaps , until he gets us ?
i found dad .
virgil ?
no .
jack !
the white house .
how ?
aw come on , miss price !
no , you - you want me to come over there ? i'll smack your face .
somethin ' was upsettin ' you bad last night , and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me so's i could help ...
i don't want to see the dress .
that only proves my point more . the word is a badge for her failures at school .
i didn't start out to be a bank teller . i was gonna be a ballplayer . even had an offer to play short for the newark eagles .
and you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun . if leons austrian was looking for you i reckon hed have found you before i did .
thanks , listen i wanna apologize for the other day downstairs , about vada , i was a little harsh .
really ? is the food that bad ?
what ? i can't hear you ...
it's no problem . i called mom and dad in germany ; it's like they were there .
and how much will your " fun " net you this time ?
i don't think you understand me , court composer .
what a rip-off . come on . we gotta find that chick .
helen ? it's simon . is it safe to talk ?
the porter ... what's his name ? old asbestos - -
maybe you shouldn't be working here so much . you don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life .
yeah ...
oh . that's nice .
hello , alabama .
okay , i do . get back up here .
that's a crackpot theory . everybody says so .
shit and fried eggs .
so you never knew your mother ?
no .
just one for a start .
i'm asking you to leave .
so give him a tour . he doesn't know enough to ask the right questions .
that's crazy - - why not ?
i thought she wasn't your girlfriend , dude .
how soon ? ...
what are you -
come on , we got to get this up . he's coming .
turn that thing off , will you ? it's driving me nuts ! what's rosebud ?
did you tell her ?
where do the air ducts lead ?
- - in magazines nobody reads .
excuse me .
they were performance pieces .
and ?
don't treat me like i'm stupid . it pisses me off .
what business is it of yours where i'm from , friendo ?
wait , i think i have them sighted . what's the word , frank ?
no , i don't .
leave the light off .
you were never going to let women serve in combat . you always had a safety net . or thought you did .
and " is " ... ?
well spoke . true to the mark . and if it's wine you're wanting , it's wine we shall have .
they sure ain't no black man's books in here .
not in the bedroom . do it !
i was grateful .
oh , tract housing , huh ? i guess i shouldn't complain about my duplex in burbank . what a dump . some places have a murphy bed , this place has a murphy <u> shower </u> . i still don't know where to hang the towels !
bottom hose was shot too . rotted clear through . had to put a new one in . runs like a dream now .
it's too late , charles . i'm sorry .
it's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the venezuelan syndicate has a daughter , and -
he never told me .
that's the big surprise . your new studio--after all , writers do need a place to work .
well , we didn't get any help on that . a lot of people saw it . nobody's talking .
why ?
but i see , she didn't mean old in years . you always carry an umbrella , bruce ?
just open the door , please .
sure thing , mr . karpf . c'mon .
you're not listening . really know what you're going to do before you do it .
get that stuff out of her stomach - - if it isn't too late . you better put some coffee on - - and pray .
you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people .
i've made arrangements with dr . gynde for 10:30 . but jeffrey , you'll have to walk over ; i need the car this morning .
he's nervous , sir . he's heard you're looking for a new director .
well , don't ever start up on ' em , cause once you do you can't stop . i tell myself i'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast , and here i sit with half the day gone .
it doesn't necessarily mean she's ...
sense memory . i see you got to win the fight ...
what ?
good idea !
what about the worms ? most of these apples are the drops--off the ground , right ? there have to be worms .
well , as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection , while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment , i'll be sound as a pound .
happy fuckin ' halloween .
grazie , a lei , signor antonio !
i remember a bat . a monster . a demon . chasing me . oh my god , alfred .
tell me - - what was slim hayward wearing ?
good , i wasn't sure you were up to it .
okay , now . easy steps . easy breaths . easy steps .
i'm prepared to take the blame .
you think so ?
it's crazy out there . young girls wearing mini this and mini that . sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman , she makes me feel like i'm bothering her . she stares down like she's afraid to look at me . why she do that ? why can't she look me in the face ?
what ?
this guy , zero , he drifts around , that's how they all start , drifting around , their minds filling up with fantasies . he thinks he's real smart , laughs at us , laughs at his victims . but he has left a trail , and the trail is somewhere in those names . you know how to reach me . take my advice , when dealing with these fbi tight-asses , go by the book . that's what i did .
a little bit .
oh , it's just so romantic . i just want to put on a long gown ...
come on , where's your enthusiasm ?
people actually used to pay you for this ?
i don't know . it just feels good . always did .
' kay , well , could you walk faster , please .
you're awake . good girl .
you in here . [ beat ] works like a drug .
what is it ?
you fuckin ' don't do that . you don't do it , you cocksucker . i'll fuckin ' kill you with my barehands . go . get the fuck fuck - - we're going back and we finish the show - -
they wanted a girl .
in heaven .
what time did matt brown get in ?
his camera ... it's still recording .
liz , do i have to spell it out for you ? lee oswald was no ordinary soldier . that was no accident he was in russia . he was probably in military intelligence . that's why he was trained in russian .
why wouldn't we be . i mean , look around . so far so good .
they've already been identi - fied . there's no doubt .
we know him . he's over your left shoulder , looking right at you as you go on ..
three-cent stamp .
okay , santa claus . 2000 lunches .
lucky kid .
i had my kid brother , dominick , run it for me .
do you want us to come with you ?
wrong ! i'm getting my first series of hormone shots ! and once those babies kick in , they're gonna remove my organs , and make me a woman !
i think you do . but i thank god we all don't .
try me .
i promised to protect her from people like you .
my dear mademoiselle , perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca , human life is cheap . good night , mademoiselle .
zack , don't !
like what ?
quit acting like some retard or i'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been .
now amy
what ? what am i supposed to sense ?
i'm sorry about your financial problems . i really am . but they are your problems .
thank you . i can't imagine how mrs . kane came to make such a silly mistake . the sedative dr . wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her .
eve is going to stay . the house will not be closed .
how old are you ?
my mate has been acting very strange . i can't explain it ... but . i haven't been feeling very well myself . i don't know , maybe it's me . i needed an sp9 last night . i feel as if something odd were happening to me . something ...
mister - - miss - - such politeness !
you don't look half-bad .
don't bother looking . it's in your skull .
no .
there is only one bed .
but - - but - -
of course he does . what about you ? have you just never had one with kevin - - or have you never had one , period ?
i'm going to get a doctor .
greer ?
what are you going to do ? charge me with smoking ?
i'm terribly sorry - i have a bad memory ...
it's a letter from the school . . . from miss stewart .
uh , i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
saint thomas aquinas . he wrote about the seven deadly sins .
you'll get to see the file on this case . and there's another reason .
yes , madame .
your lips are soft when you kiss .
meat .
well , why not say the least and get it over with ?
what does that mean ?
open the door .
well ... what did you want to talk to me about ?
duff - you know those women you used to know - -
i don't know , i'll get her a card or something .
i'll try , but this week we go into survival training , so i can't make any promises . well , thanks again for dinner . thank your mom again for me , will you ?
i'm sorry , but i'm a bit of a stickler for paper work . where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures ?
just so i understand ... you're " thing " is ... acting like an idiot ? or is it actually being an idiot ? besides - -
phil collins ? are you sure he isn't drinking and driving ?
collateral damage .
he's movin ' to your left - - don't let him no more - - dance and stick , hear ? don't play - - i know what ya feelin ' , but don't play .
excuse me .
i'll need the sergeant's okay on that .
no thanks .
she tried everything to get them , and nothing worked . she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me , but that was all over long ago . for your sake , she pretended it wasn't , and i let her pretend .
uh-uh . the dog . i think i know now why thorwald killed it .
what's your problem beavis ?
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission ...
it moved me . i did relate to it - - i really did . it was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up - - and that might not have been my choice ... but it's real and it got me ... and i think a lot of the time i'm too conservative about that kind of stuff . okay ?
oh , like your life's any better ?
do you think you have free license to be insulting ? believe me you have not . you think you're superior , but you're quite an ordinary man .
why'd they break off ? was there water in that canyon ?
on whose authority , corporal ?
go and get yourself washed up , mr . bernstein . there doesn't seem to be an serious injury .
why ?
you crave what i might show you . what you can learn . what i can give you . so much more than michael can .
line it up now , nice and easy ...
i'll try , d-d-dammit ! you can't ask any more than that !
liz do you take fisher to be your beloved husband , to respect , honor and cherish him till death do you part ?
come on , ma . out with it . who came out first ?
in a minute .
all i'm saying is , your little bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out .
no breach-of-promise case has been filed . the matter has been settled out of court .
what's that ?
i know something no one knows . he has had his finger removed . on his left hand . it left a scar .
too bad .
that's ' cause i <u> wasn't </u> there .
shit ! our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores . we got about two clips left for an autoloader , and that's it .
it can be arranged ...
is this a bad time .
where ?
you'd better be .
but one day i'll catch you ... like i caught her ...
i'm sorry , sir . general schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty .
i don't want to think about it . if i think about it he'll hear me . he'll find me .
yes . exhilarating , isn't it !
please jeffrey . i don't want to be responsible for any delayed after - effects .
i don't think mom cares that much that my ... that peter left .
you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the - -
hello , jimmy . what's up ?
nothing new . he's just going off duty .
aside from the obvious ?
leonard , you don't have a clue what's going on . you don't even know my name .
a few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new .
camila . camila valencias .
i can say , with the utmost sincerity , that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use .
it's not that easy , wayne . donuts and a smoke only get you so far . you're gonna have to do your job .
all i'm saying is they've got people who handle these things , david . they want hbo , they'll call you .
uh huh .
how can i do anything if i'm being watched every second ?
why don't you just stay there , and you can have it everyday .
what would you say if you found your safe had been robbed ?
no .
don't you feel there are different sides to every personality ? maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act . we're all human .
stop . you experimented in college . i don't want to hear about that .
one night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin ' from all them mirrors he broke ... four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off ... after he dies , he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over ...
we'll beam aboard and stop it - -
listen to me ! he's been going on and on about mars . he's really been there .
bah ! you faeries have the morals of ferrets .
come on . these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist .
huh . let me think .
i'm not asking for us to be together .
where will my toys be ?
i played piano in a few places .
haven't you got a bullet i can bite ?
oh .
didn't mean to pry . i just have this theory . some of us who got to good at this ? we were - - escaping something .
nothing ...
but i'm not prepared to die .
i think in the spirit of group therapy , it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others .
it'll just be me .
what ?
i remember when the echo had class - - the paper that could bring down governments .
what do you think .
well , you're half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
so did i ...
it's attitude ... how you carry yourself .
what time is it ?
her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
so you're going to kill her ? put the gun down claire .
sure . i'd be glad to .
medium rare , please .
i'll boil some water .
well , it's over .
of <u> course </u> we weren't scared . just a little startled . one of those sushi dropped down my kamali .
why not ?
... i don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist , exactly .
yes , ma'am , you can deposit your money here .
hello , eve .
... foreign service .
he said it was important to have standards . he said nobody has pride anymore .
no , his wife is .
i knew it , soon as i saw they were offering a reward .
a visit from an old friend .
susie , as always , is free to say anything she thinks . go on , dear , say exactly what's on your mind , dear .
you live with him .
dave , it's going to be okay . just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you . i guarantee it .
what ... ?
a man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body ?
lay off , i said - - if you don't want your head handed to you .
hi , honey .
how do you know who's real and who's not ?
security consultant .
where did you meet my father ?
don't kid yourself - - she means it .
i have to qualify , is that it ?
you couldn't have known she was listening the night i dictated that entry into my log . you were proud of her achievements as a vulcan .
i plan to . you want a tip ?
history , leonard . <u> history </u> . everything else is conversation ... how's the other matter ?
that was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked . i heard you were a hitter .
i happen to know so .
let's move out !
do you really ?
yeah ?
that's right . but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be " faithful " to my sister .
shit , i bet i been laid more'n you have .
look , we clear out , we get to the shack , we get safe . we hang there awhile . i'll come back . i'll check it out . but right now we can't - -
... i realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on gardiner . we have no material on him - zilch ...
well , this is a small town , and it was even smaller then . most all the babies i delivered were from local families . richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came . i did it right here at the house .
you should try adderall .
i haven't forgotten .
yes .
but ... you called .
i'm trying to quit .
and did everything - - ?

are you saying our order don't make sense ?
i did .
he was here last night till about two o'clock . i hear you really got stuck with a dog last night .
and how do we account for the interest of such a charming man , an interest in torture ?
i think his leg is broken .
it clearly is why .
i mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance .
the wounds are the same . cauterized . no chopping or half-measures either . one stroke took the head . have you seen , doctor ... ? even the spinal bone ... sliced as smooth as butter .
who put this dirty picture in buckaroo's viewer ?
male , 40 to 50 years old , five-foot - eleven , chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records - -

its too late .
how much ?
keep going over these . i don't want anybody getting lost .
willie , shut up . yo ' old ass need to get in a little bit o ' trouble sometimes .
you ever feel bad about any of this ?
three weeks before midterm elections ? you need me .

if she's so innocent , how come she murdered a child ?
knowing i have to die ...
you can't cheat an honest man .
old woman ?
all my things have me in them . i don't want you to be like me .

for christ's sake , john ! throw me the keys !
how could i not ? she had to know .
j'ai pas confiance en lui .
good night , mrs . brett !

fine ... that guy's great .
disintegrated ?
what i made you do , mama ?
you think i made that up about the gun ...
i asked you to be nice to him .
what is the point in that ? even if it was a bug they would have taken it with ' em .
what did you guys think ?
i just happen to know it . i had a nightmare and i screamed for you . you weren't here . where were you ?
it'll end . it'll end with him and mccay . then the park shuts down . permanently .
do you think a lot about girls ?
what do we do now ?
sounds like a threat .
no ! please ! shut up , will you ? we're trying to think here . it is sort of like being a puppeteer . i like that about it .
i had an accident .
you could consecrate with her , my friend .

like recognizing criminals by their crimes .
i shore could , miss rebecca .
this isn't your style , dillon .

no ! i can't explain now . oh , look - - the pearls . you wear them now ...
then where was it ? i'm sent out there ... i'm told that the <u> arrest </u> must be a joint ...
i had one <u> puff </u> on a <u> pipe </u> .
i gotta be going .
come on . you're fucking hungover .
what ?
well , sir , i don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different ... whatever you call it ... " dimensions . " it's stressful , you said it yourselves , it gets you confused . you don't know what's real and what's not .
telephone repairman .
yeah , you really showed him , daddy - - you just about cut your own hand off , and all you cut off * him * was his clothes !
he's lost complete faith in me - -
and what is the state of your memory now ?
why did he buy a film of some poor , lost girl getting butchered ?
yeah ?
gee ... that's wonderful , jill .
hi , sandy .
what in the hell do you think you're doing ? slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace .
you and verona ?
oh , really ?
yeah , i got a more fun idea myself .
some part of you suspects - - even if you don't know for sure - - that what i'm saying is true .
before or after i have my nervous breakfown ?
i'm almost afraid to . what did you bring me , contraband klingon - -
once again , don't call me eugene . a recent unknown intruder penetrated , using a superuser acount , giving him access to our whole system .
you have to go .
you're full of interesting facts , aren't you ?
how much did ya lose ?
you should thank me - - that girl was not easy to find . what'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough ?
because you need to understand . and you need ... to be careful .
i was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was o . k . by me . i introduced him to people--even after i knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked . it didn't seem to matter--i didn't care - - - - until he roped ned in . some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass .
you know a gal named maya ? works at the hitching post ?
curly , where's your car ?
going somewhere ?
i have no idea . they put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows . the shutters up here are nailed shut .
sam ! no !

how do you know catherine tramell saw my reports ?
we miss you . we miss our son .
he gave acosta's people a receiver .
no , you're not either .
nope . and i didn't ask .
they're a bloody sight warmer than we are .
don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in .
no , i don't know . tell me .
you think it's cool ?
why did you send me after friedman ? to atone for your sins ?
on the morrow i'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true .
i've got fifty thousand dollars to invest .
all well and good - - but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in ?
cook school - - that did it .
... it was a great city . the greatest city in the world .
that possibility never occurred to you ?
don't thank me . i should thank you . so long .
no doubt , brother - i figured as much back there in the restaurant . that's why i invited you out here for this advanced tutorial .
int . brynner's van - night .
we all got a secret side , baby . hope you don't think i been lyin ' to you ' bout other things , sugar .
over there !
just what it is . antibodies , destroying bacteria - - or any other foreign invader that threatens the system .
like a haunted house , right ? i don't believe in ghosts .
yeah . she says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood . ' bye , dad .
what do you mean ? it's it's a goddamn mini-mart ? !
sorry to interrupt . your dad sent me .
you mean baron von gaigern ?
your excellency , the eyes of the world are upon you . notables from every land are gathered here in your honor - - this is a gala day for us .
how long will we have to stay down here ?
scotty - - what's left ?
i do right by johnny torrio and he does right by me .
i remember you .
it's going famously , son , famously !
in so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave . a figurehead .
we're being blamed for these deaths . scully , i want to know what this man died of . don't you ?
yeah , yeah , i was awake anyway so i figured they got it made . eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs .
[ the car will not be powerful and have no trunk . ]
hold on a second .
um . you .
shhhhhh .
wanna dance ?
now , you can take care of the dauntless , right ?
i wouldn't have come if i had known that you were here . believe me , rick , it's true . i didn't know .
but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag . somebody would have seen it .
you stole her from me . now i want her back .
who hasn't--one way or another ?
what do you want me to say ? my mother's tummy ?
the jacket .
i mean , who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit . goldwater put it right . he said : " well for christ's sake , everybody bugs everybody else ; we know that . " ... it's the cover-up , not the deed that's really bad here . if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it ; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course . that's the tragedy of all this . mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway . it's time he assumed some responsibility .
i knew something would happen when they started puttin ' up fences and passin ' laws .
a porsche .
okay ... well , i'll see ya then .
i'll tell ya something : it made me a model prisoner . put me right off any escape attempts . tunnel my way to freedom after that experience ? not bloody likely .
can i talk here ? let me talk .
like hell it's over . you told me he wasn't doing this anymore .
yes , barbara ... barbara ...
where are we going ? huh ?
you want to hear me out ?
case closed , okay ? thirty seconds .
i've got you !
that wasn't bullshit , i said we love each other .
in case you'd like to know , mr . bernstein , he's at the huntington memorial hospital on 180th street .
i was dead , too .

i'm not gonna kill him . shut the fuck up . what , do you know what you're talkin ' about ? i'm not killing anyb -
i'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - i think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve .
it's easy . i've done it .
you , please .
waitaminit , dudes ! i got it ! we find four really small kids , beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets . what do you think ?
can't let you in ... sorry .
no , they're not in the car . no , i don't have them on me . ya wanna go with me and get ' em ? yes , we can go right now . but first listen to what i'm telling you . we were fuckin ' set up ! somebody is in league with the cops . we got a judas in our midst . and i'm thinkin ' we should have our fuckin ' heads examined for waiting around here .
go-go-go-go-go ! ! !
there's no reason to decide any of us are going to die .
nothing ... i just immerse you in water ...
i'm asking how much .
where were you ?
yes ...
i ain't gonna shoot her .
where can i meet this man ?
i think i will pass ...
well , of course he is !
i don't want to hear any more about it . if you don't get married , i'll fire both of you .

miles .
but we don't need it , i'm sure .
i know you have . c'mere .
no , just give you a splitting headache .
we still think the temporal lobe ...
oh - -
revenge is a dish best served cold ... well , it's payback time , sport .  ... see that building ? i bought into it ten years ago . it was my first real estate deal . i sold it a couple of years later and made an $ 800,000 dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world ... now , it's a day's pay ... i had a mole in wildman's employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired ...
yeah , but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from ?
it's nothing . my men take great delight in routing the enemy . don't trouble yourself , beauty .
i don't remember .
what happened ?
heart . give magua new heart .
wait for gus to get here , sis .
excuse me , that's not exactly the kind of information i was after . you see , he's been missing for quite some time now , and ...
yes , indeed . i wonder why he left me all that money ? i don't need it .
that's what you pay to find out . right , jack ?
that's it , i'm making an oath . i'll never procrastinate about anything again . life is too fucking short .
this will do .

i've only got one question for you , and i want an honest answer . have you taken any human victims yet ?
you think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months !
sha la la la that ain't no crime .
please ... that's enough . i * loved * you , too--you know i did .
you weren't there , you don't know what happened .
no !
i'm sick of hearing about that lame dog . i've got a lot going for me . i'm going places . i'm going to be someone . i'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if i have to kill to do it . i'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me . i don't even know why i'm wasting my time here with you . i should be with my people ...
must have taken a hell of a long time .
well , isn't there some other place ? it's rather confidential , what i have to say .
shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know - -
used to see the natives eating roots when i was a kid in nome .

that somebody out there knows what it's like to be ... in here .
yeah , but we're - -
i'm not saying another word .

oh ... a lot of things . several different factors . will you see her , doctor mumford ?
why would you care ?
benjamin - - i really do .
yes . i hear you .
i'm with don on this .
pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is .
how much ?
it sure is .
smoking is absolutely forbidden .
i can't say it out loud . i don't use bad language .
hurry up .
the walkers have agreed . the ottos . nicole burnell's parents . it's important to initiate proceedings right away . things get covered up . people lie . that's why we have to begin our investigation quickly . before the evidence disappears . that's why i'm out here tonight .
father , i don't understand . tell me what happened ?
there's a few things you don't know about women , brother malcolm . they're possessive and vain .

oh . that . i know what you mean . i had nightmares all week .
what sub ?
why would the little ones believe that * anyone * would adopt him ?
don't eat all those sweets . you'll get sick .
that's what they call the repository . every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room .
diedre mayfair was your mother .
yeah .

i ordered you to defend this ship .
no . it's the truth , really . i swear it . danny told me . he went up into one of the bedrooms , the door was open , and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub . she tried to strangle him .
thanks .
that's not true .
you need to make these your primary " action items . "
how ? shoot him ? you know about him and bullets . not to mention knives , tanks , bombs ...
how ' bout the score was his idea to begin with ?

radar !
the old man saw an owl . over there in the dry wash . last week .
i've got to get her out of here .
i don't think darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair .
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she's in the state she's in today .
like dykes and dogs .
and it won't be pleasant .
you missed him !
bainbridge books .
... a dewars on the rocks and a bud , please .
i told you . we met yesterday .

oh , shit . take your time ! don't get suckered ! this man is a murderer ! in his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators . please , just take the fall !
my , my ... ah , who are you ?
my mary - - she's not in japan , she's single , and she's got no rugrats . she does have a little gambling problem , she plays the football cards a bit too much , but she's a babe , a surgeon babe !
i don't know what he thinks ... i don't know what i think ... i don't even know why i'm talking about it ... it's silly ... i'm getting too old for this sort of thing ...
dude . what are you doing here ?
bob taught you how to get electrocuted .
sophie , this is chauncey gardiner ...
radio ! what is radio ?

what do you mean no i won't ? don't presume to tell me what i will and will not do . you don't know me .
he <u> has </u> been going after everything . it <u> could </u> work . but this is not a happy cow .
i wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids .
mikey , you look beautiful !
somebody find him a knife .
... i guess it's ... just a matter of personal taste .
being violently ill to her tummy .
the extras are in their places . now we need the star . wouldn't you like to get in the pool ?
but , mr . stone , i am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience . is this your signature ?
so why did you leave ?
i ... i guess not . i didn't mean i didn't want one ' cause of you bein ' cut up . i didn't mean that .
that doesn't mean you do . you can't possibly trust him , he's ... perverted .
gwen ?
hey ...
right .
it's still early . what's your next class ?
stay open . who knows ? lightning could strike .
yeah .
this tie doesn't go with blue !
that a fact ?
fighters have rules too : friendship , trust , integrity ... without rules , we wouldn't survive for long .
please , what else could it mean ?
no , we should reach the base of the brain shortly . and from there , it's not far to the site of the injury .
risa , i serviced that bus . at the garage . there's nothing wrong with it .
margo , you haven't heard ?
thanks .
what did that man mean when he said you were ... . ?
you're emotional . you're erratic . you say any god damn thing that comes into your head . and i'm not saying that's bad . that can be great ; that can be a lot of fun - -
when we get to the next corner jump out .
john ...
no . just fossils , far as i know .
then what brings you out on such a night ?
what are we going to do ? talk about me sex life ?
and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and ...
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm !
kelvin , she begged me . i had a short - range version of the destabilizer prototype , a miniature with a range of a few meters . she walked into it and disappeared . she was gone .
- - and your teacher said , " you're too late , truman . there's nothing left to explore . "
johnny , i know , but ...
first i couldn't feel it , but now i feel it easily , it's like a little acorn .
i'm so happy you're happy .
okay . now , so he's in jail . he , finally , he gets to see the light , he calls up harrington , he says he thinks he made a mistake . as if by magic , charges against him are dropped , he's released from jail . p . s . he's fired from the firm , his wife divorces him , he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years . you like that story ?
transpo ? how they bringing the loads in ... ?
where did you find it by the way ?
you'd better call and cancel .
we don't have any fog this time of year , mitch .
i'm right enough to stand on my own two feet . now take this goddamn chain off ...
how much did they get from the safe ?
radar , he's underwater . but he's definitely coming .
still worried ?
nobody knows who you are . make it look like a robbery .
god , the old man would've loved this view , wouldn't he ?
that's a tragedy . can i finish my story please ? i began my search for meaning . i was a catholic , jew , scientologist , sufi , buddhist . i went to a psychologist , psychiatrist , herbalist , nutritionist , a shaman , and a psychic . and they all pretty much say the same stuff .
jackson , steinem ...
i'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . i call it the " demolished " look . they've already heard about it at house and garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets ... lived in . is that alright ? i'd love to have it in my portfolio .
if you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room , you knew one of us was in there getting laid .
no , eve . i'm not related to basil and perdita .
any special reason ?
let me guess . the floss is garotte wire , the toothpaste contains plastic explosives , and the toothbrush is the detonation device .
just him , sir !
i'll be fine . he's a different story .
please .
speak of the devil .
there's something i ought to tell you .
what about ?
buttfucks the cabin ?
yeah ?
i believe i said i'd be tempted .
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere ?
have you ever smelled burning flesh ? i smelt it four miles away . four miles away , i smelt it . have you ever seen the gas chambers , the crematoria ? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses ? you talk to me about culture , art and music ? you putting that in the scales , wilhelm ? you setting culture , art and music against the millions put to death by your pals ? they had orchestras in the camps . they played beethoven , wagner . the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families . i don't understand the germans ' relationship with music . what do you need music for ? your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated ? yes , i blame you for not getting hanged , i blame you for your cowardice . you strutted and swaggered , you fucking piece of shit , king-pin in a shithouse . you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows , and i say to you , lies !
there's a certain amount of information there .
it's the only true thing i know anymore .
you're keeping a record , are you ?
that's good enough for me .
sorry ? !
that's right .
it's always beautiful at this time . peaceful ...
gondorff , you gonna teach me the big con or not ?
what the hell are you doin ' in there ?
i have personally vouched for you in this matter , captain .
you gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk . that doughnut's chocolate you , know .
you burn , you pine , you perish ?
she's out there , but i doubt she'll show herself . we'll keep our eyes open . sooner or later , she'll come for the girl .
then what ? who's going to do what ?
but i had heard his wounds were mortal .
get out of the way .
captain ... we've got less than ten minutes before that vulcan ship leaves the system . we've got to go <u> now </u> .
wait a minute - i've got it . there ! off the port bow !
you know , it really is beautiful up there . let me show you . we'll take a walk after dinner .
did you have trouble performing ? yeah , that's ...
all men lose heart . all betray . it is exactly why we must make the choices we make .
spoken like a true believer .
dr . duvall i insist you test the laser .
wrong . he sold you $ 3,000 worth of scrub brush .
with a shotgun . it kills him , and it shreads the money . i mean , what are the odds ?
big threat . tv would ream you .
hey ! d'you have any other complaints ? just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole ! okay ?
he told you .
- - can i get you ?
when was the last time you talked to your son ?
oh , yes , please .
for mother's day , i used all my allowance that i'd been saving to take my mother to kansas city . we got our nails done and had lunch at " skies , " a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city . it was the last outing we took together . she died the following year .
you are ...
ah keeps the ol ' circle turning - - this ol ' clock needs plenty o ' care . time is money , miss archuh , and money - - it drives that ol ' global economy and keeps big daddy earth a-spinnin ' on ' roun ' . ya see , without that capital fo'mation - -
my only concern is the human tribunal . isn't it yours ?
police station . i ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason .
you scurvy shyster bastard ! watch your language ! you're talking to a doctor of journalism !
i'm - - i'm sorry .

we understand your concern , but we've made our decision , doctor . any questions ? anybody ?
other than me .
good night .

what brings you down from boston , jake ? taking advantage of the long weekend ?
for christ's sake , violet ! i heard you ! thin walls , remember ?
should i wait up ? we've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow .
... to prove something to myself ... to prove i'm stronger than i think i am .

i did .
not a bleep .
i do all the work . somebody don't like it , fuck him .
no sir .

you stole that .
what , you gonna give it all up for a maple twist ? how dumb you gotta be ? that's exactly what they - -

a paleontologist .
i hate snails and blue cheese . especially together . <u> hate </u> .
what are we going to do about it , al ?
see you at the wedding .
i'll pay you 500 each in advance and i'll mount you on those .

jim , there is an historic opportunity here -
that's the first thing that ran through my mind when i saw you . i thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade .
hey , if you live another week i'll be impressed .
it does ? what ?
they're already dead . they can't feel a thing .
it was there . this angry music all by itself . and i heard whispering .
hey , this is the company's posters , and the company won't like this .
i'm for that .
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart ?
hi . donna irving ?
hi , is vada home ?
who'd you have lunch with ?
not in a routine autopsy , but if we looked at the spinal fluid , there might be a high level of iodine , but it's difficult to know . whatcha thinkin ' , jim ?
then how come they haven't set the bail yet ? that's unconstitutional .
they weren't my shoes . mine were too small .
peter , this is very nice , but you don't have to do any of this , you know .
you must get away . before i cut . i'm not cutting if you're here . he's struggling . he's going to topple over if he cuts .
yeah , so ... i'm gonna wait and see what happens there ... but that sounds great , yeah .
maybe on earth there is one ... but not when you dive ... you see , to dive deep into the sea , for no reason ... just to do it . it's a feeling ... i don't know how to say this ... voluptuous ?
i've , uh ... gotta find , gotta get a phone number in my desk . i forgot to phone mel kaufman .
oh , would you stop lying mother !

i didn't know her . the body i took knew her . the man she met in the coffee shop this morning . i - uh - took him .
what ?
yeah , we should never let a woman come between us again .
what's up ?
the book without pages . open before you , all around us . you can see it in bits and pieces , for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance , why , it would burn him to cinders .
maybe . and maybe they'd at least be talking to us ! now tell your ' partner ' to stay out of it , or so help me if he lives through this i'll put him behind bars myself !
danny , i don't like this fuckin ' guy .
have a nice day .
we think it's ricky tan . if you don't want to take the case , i'll understand .
entertainers don't count .
sixteen times .
forget it .
i read the article .
did sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend ?
i'm tired of owing you things . you're free to go . go ahead .
i was . . . uh . . . just wondering about the .. . . the .. . . the uh , arrangements . sleeping arrangements .
check it out . not for the faint of heart .
can there be ... some kind of test ? to find out who's what ?
we'll see . let's try clark .
okay , so ... help me with this one , joe ... is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth ? or , is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u> their </u> mouth ?
it doesn't mean anything . it was written before i went out there . before the ho .
try ' flintstone . '
i guess .
before i do - - i was hoping we might be alone , bill .
he implied it .
five , seven , eight dollars .
why don't you ask your girlfriend ?
it doesn't look like that .
i'd give you a very good price .
blondes .
what are you talking about ? sugar and me , we're just like sisters .
i want a tape .
that dumb immigrant'll flop on me . i know it . can you imagine butch doing this to me - - at a time like this ?
oh for christ's sake -
i've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends ... but it still comes to three thousand .
yeah .
seven pounds , eight , i suppose . why ?
i think i've killed him . martin , my husband , i've killed him ! that is , i'm not sure , but ...
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them .
god knows .
i don't think she can do it . you saw what happened .
i have to get back . i'm having dinner with the danvers .
krueger's in the real world ... maybe he's mortal , like us .
but , sidney darling , the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning !

horny bastard .
but sergeant ...
no .
yeah .
what d'you expect me to do ?
yes .
you know , i'll bet you he makes it with a majority .

i don't think it knows it's torturing us . it's just watching .
i don't know . i never heard of the nite owl till today .
who's he ?
joel , don't jerk me . i spent a lot o ' time settin ' this one up .
they got him ! wait a minute - - hold the wire . they got earl williams surrounded - - the riot squad has - - in his house .
and the alley was a mistake . never corner yourself like that . if they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now . one vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten .
i don't understand what you mean .
kay - -
what's a long time ?
please ... shoot me .
i just don't get this all . it was them that went for me , brothers . you're not on their side and can't be . you can't be dim . it was someone we fillied with back in the old days ... trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time . you remember , dim ?

there's no " we " . there's a me . all i have to do is make it along the north wall to bitker ladder . what you're doing is going back down to the station to get help . and don't put on that mad face .
then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone , and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste , all squeezed out .
that's a great philosophy .
shut up ! just pump her out !
i'm sure . and kate , thank you for coming . thank you for being such a good friend .
oh my god , so good . that girl can fuck .
of course , the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more .
he's dead ? am i bad luck or what ?
what kind of trouble - - ?
twenty dollars each time . hell , it's no secret . that's what i'm here for .
no .
what a heel ! i spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled , i buy me a new negligee , i bake him a great big pizza pie ... - and where were you ?

there was this other place where they served live monkey brains . sweat to god . you walk in , they bring the little monkey out , shave his head , crack it open , and you eat it's brains while it's still alive . i didn't go in , though , ' cause i didn't have any money and my mom has a saying : " don't write any checks you can't cash " .

you'd be amazed at what some people will believe .
i read that with a quantum increase of seven .

why do you think she left you ?
here ?
let me put it this way : have you ever heard of plato , aristotle , socrates ?
get over what ? i don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody i know .
what is with you tonight ?
but father , it's not fair .
where did you learn it ?
excuse me , doc , i've got a plane to land .
yes .
there won't be any rest of the trip . over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along . so keep your money . you'll need it for the fare . i'm fed up with you . i was fed up with you before we started .

hate that .
i never saw this girl in my life . is this a kind of joke ?
the truck ?
you got a hall of fame arm but you're pissing it away .
... that's what he's here for , isn't he ?
i don't believe you .
no .
which is also why i've withheld this information from nato and our allies .
she wasn't a nun ?
when do i get time for me ?
but don't you have to work ?
dark operations . wet work . kidnaping . assassination .
why , she wasn't no more'n a kid when i went up .
what was it . what was it , honey ?
don't run off - - like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind .
sir !
yes ...
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .
i think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job .
no , i just meant ...
you couldn't do it , period .
just now .
in my bag , in the car .
out ? where are you going ?
then your father's a wimp .
i ain't heard of nothin ' .
i'm living proof of that sad fact .
to recover the mind set .
bunny : i had an idea : a slinky , that falls <u> up </u> ... naa , we can figure that <u> out </u> . what i'm wondering : what do we <u> call </u> it ... you got my number ...
no , you can , you can . you've been so nice to me .
expecting anyone ?
just as i thought . he drifted up here with the gulf stream , from southern waters .
shut them up !
really . you want to dance with someone else ?
pay attention , mr . watson . pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt .
they may be looking for us , james . use this . you can fix it in the men's room .
does that paper say we've been indicted ? does it say exley's a hero for squealing me and stensland off ?
the dispensary . i'm talking clean pharmaceutical high . a night at club meth .
no ! should i ?
no .
what's this guy's problem ?
that's cheating ?
good ! do you know how we say " make love " ?
what ?
you get recognized , convict , you get a country-western funeral .
the thieves .
trickery and flummery or not , she's going there tomorrow on the bus ! it's settled ! and i must say we've been more than fair to you , rose , it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that !
ouch !
yeah .
i don't know that . that's what i'm telling you .
maybe i have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do , susie . you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob , the cia , fbi , and army intelligence and who knows what else , when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people ! we got leaks everywhere ! we're going to trial here ! what the hell do we really got ? oswald , ruby , banister , ferrie are dead . shaw - maybe he's an agent , i don't know , but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail ' cause of his homosexuality .
where are you ? patrick , what's wrong ?
hurricane hormone . it's flattened the whole school . guess what ?
how do you spell it ?
good . cos you know how it plays . six years ago , i let you go free . but the next time ... the next time sends you away for'a long , long while ...
what do you two fight about ?
you should see the other bitch . what time you got ?
so now i need you to hack into her .
my son , no one can speak for god .
so , i guess i can go now .
you'd lie to protect him .
if it's funny i'm going to laugh .
he thought you were a woman , airk !
no ! he's very alive . well ... sort of . he's old , and frail - - but he's still bela lugosi ! and he's really nice .
i don't believe it .
what about keith ?
want to cry now ?
cause if you don't know the number , i can page you with the number so you'll have the number .
and you b-believe that .
what does ?
i believe i have .
of course it is .
i just , i don't know ...
well do you like him ?
i see .
who ?
i'm twenty-five years old , ma'am .
no ; who were the three , besides me ?
i think you're forgetting , this is my car . i drove it up here .
we take the avedon , right ? simple .
of course . i don't want no okie from muscogee . i can get that right here in port angeles .
i order out mostly . so what do i owe this visit to ?
just an expression ... what i meant was ... i'd do just about anything ... to get away . wouldn't you ?
what'm i gonna do with half a cent ? buy me a thoroughbred cockroach ? everybody loses them fractions ?
well , this place sorta reminds me of something .
good . i'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap .
it's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask " what's your major ? " i hate that .
stanzi !
it's what they want you to see .
oh . thatd be rhian , a welsh chick he used to lay at weekends . she got wise and dumped him months ago ...
that's very linear sheriff .
we did some researching in the archives . sid , something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mother's murder . for two years of her life , 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth .
what disadvantage ?
nancy !
i have to go .
are you lyin ' to me ?
scoundrels ? they weren't scoundrels , they were just boys .
i dunno , sir . brought you up a chevy .
you think he got my license plates ?
well , you can't believe everything you read in magazines .
for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team , you sure got a big mouth , kent .
you think they're still up there ?
belle .
oh sure , everything is complimentary . until you get the bill .
so we're gonna knock ' em both off ?
right .
you mean like couples ?
how could she have done this to me ? how could anyone do this to anyone ?
don't say that .
it's not that bad .
not at all , dean . good of you to spare the time .
i told you , no . i'm not that type .
we scared each other pretty good didn't we ?
it's you , sir . and it started the day i came here .
jennie . you've tested positive for the hiv infection .
what ?
stone is their spokesman . you think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it ? stone's a disinformation flunky . the face that he's alive says it all .
send it back if you don't want it .
what are you working on ?
it would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you . but first things first .
is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went ?
four aces , doc .
now listen here , you little bastard , just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in . alex eyes a giant white , fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him .
well . obviously no one you have to worry about ... woody .
plan ? ... oh , yeah , the plan ... yeah ...
knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow .
this feels stupid .
you oughta be careful yourself . might end up cutting your throat .
air bubbles ! ... doctor - -
oh yeah ? how's he doing ?
did someone say i wasn't nice ?
i'm hurting .
finish what ?
this is my home .
if that sumbitch was in the race , he'd be in the winner's circle by now .
so you're gonna coast to retirement , when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity .
i must say you look very good , mr . chairman .
what ?
so the truth is more important to you than your life ?
bela , he talk . loretta , she talk . but tor , he no talk .
sir , i'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise .
you're not giving yourself a chance . don't fight it . relax .
we're not moving fast enough for him .
do you swear you didn't know ?
no one really knows . it's an ancient taboo . set forth in the sacred scrolls . the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly .
the government
who was that ?
you need help .
waddaya doing tomorrow night ?
keep away , i'm fine , i'm fine .
and how long was it before they caught up with you ?
it'll keep them fresh . if they get too dry , they'll break . and you don't want that to happen , do you ? tobacco is a plant , and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid .
why ?
eve ! my understudy ...
it's time for drastic remedies .
i was just on my way to your ladyfriend's , but i guess she found you .
you're a dumb , whacked-out little fuck , do you know that ?
you've got such beautiful hands .
... it's a teaser !
what's to be scared about ? it's just a little hiccup in the power .
get away !
yeah , but these guys have never seen a horse . they just jack off to clint eastwood .
i'm saying if he knows i'm a fuck - up , then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife ? because he fucking doesn't want her back , man ! he's had enough ! he no longer digs her ! it's all a show ! but then , why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks ? i mean , he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase , but he never asked for it back .
brad , can i talk to you a minute ?
when ' we ' . . . ? you mean , you'd like to have me live here in your house ?
what are you going to do ?
that you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
you should have said it was bring-a-bottle .
mostly . it must be my face . my mother always said i looked like a priest .
and you just figured that out ? the swede isn't a hitman , is he ? he's a surgeon . sparazza didn't want israel's heart for a trophy , he wanted it for a transplant ... why ?
where'm i goinna get a pizza this time o ' night ?
do you know what you were kidnapped by ?
i didn't steal the truck ! he owed it to me ! anyway , the important thing is i'm not goin ' through missoula !
uh-huh .
are you speaking of the worm , or ... the spaghetti .
there is one thing i need right away .
for our sake , i hope not .
it took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn .
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out .
your secretary , huh !
you don't have to say anything .
honey , i'm sorry , i think the vacation will be a good break for both of us . you'll see .
yes and i must say i've done very well with it - - perhaps even better than jacqueline .
i'd like to believe that i'm not ... but i've just never seen any proof . so i just choose not to bother with it . it's , like , i could spend my whole life thinking about it ... debating it in my head . weighing the pros and cons . and in the end , i still wouldn't have any proof . so ... i don't even debate it any more . because it's absurd . i don't want to be alone . so , does that make me , like , an atheist ?
- - viktor , that was short subject .
theo .
you promise ?
you got the admissions letter .
i didn't used to be afraid of it .
- - no .
swell .
what ?
look . i'm sorry . just let me leave .
yes , sir .
we'll split up the week . you can have lymphoma , tuberculosis and - -
all he's asking is for you to check it out .
quite a bit you didn't tell me .
nice speech . what's it supposed to mean ?
i've been working .
well , it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive .
- - is often sneered at . are you aware of that ?
salvy , would i steer you wrong ? let's say that's the truck ; it's full of cigarettes , right ? now , two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there , take the cigarettes out , sell ' em , make some cash .
you always said you wanted to live in a palace .
di , it's luce . kansas just called and said she's going to " fuck me up ! " then i heard coughing , a thud and kansas had to go . i think her grandma had another heart attack . anyway , why does she want to " fuck me up ? "
just stay there , nell !
you've got to stop them . please !
he did run ?
right here , mom ...
how could you call him ?
how ?
you said speak czech !
you know why i'm handling it very well ? because you're going to get these guys for me .
mm-hm .
just for a moment . she might have picked up a hint you'd miss .
duck , i says . " you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman , corcoran , " said the duck . " you must apologize . " but two gun corcoran would have none of it and , cursing , he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but the duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns . "
your view of what ?
- - a spy , you mean ?
nazorine , my friend , tell me what i can do .
no .
from you , pard ? never . thanks for the graduation present .
... mrs . calvert ?
i don't know . he bathed , now he is roaming the ship . he must be the only engineer in starfleet who does not go to engineering !
they didn't find the shotguns . they planted them .
henry told cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again . when henry makes a threat like that , people tend to take him seriously .
as leader of all illegal activities in casablanca , i am an influential and respected man . it would not be worth my life to do anything for monsieur laszlo . you , however , are a different matter .
and make ourselves a hell of a target .
yeah . some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead , or silver .
have you found dr . bright ?
yes , victor , i was .
that sounds so great , man . yes . yes . hey , what would you do in the afternoon ?
you might hold this for me .
awright . get into position . i'm rolling .
what the hell is this ?
what about keith ?
no . but i'm a clairvoyant . i can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place .
we need to get out of sight . come down to my suite .
it's a little late for that .
and they don't even know what it really is .
you're on !
amanda !
but yours is the one who's going to subpoena me , sam . force me to testify in court . he came by the garage this afternoon . gave me this piece of paper .
ann . will you come in ?
hey , man , tonight i'm going to teach ray about jazz .
how long until we reach the fleet ?
what could cause a tincture like this ?
then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said , " oh , somebody's been sleeping in my bed . " and then the mama bear said , " oh dear , somebody's been sleeping in my bed ! " and then the big papa bear , he roared , " and somebody's been sleeping in my bed ! " well , you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary !
sometimes i have serious doubts about you .
should i ?
i took the road less traveled , adelle .
i could be you rguard ! i could carry your spear !
frances , i'm warning you ...
i didn't say i was good at it .
no , holiness .
a friend of your fiance's .
oh . i guess you got the whole story .
i make maps .
there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand .
i need you there with me . i need your expertise on this . the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by .
light in those passages ain't so good .
he's all over the place ! nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet ! what an asshole !
that crazy brother of yours doesn't think so .
thank you , your honor . further : ms . costello is a rebuttal witness . as a ' surprise witness ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
well that was our mistake then . and then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from woolworth's . i don't know if it's the one branch or all of ' em .
hey , evelyn , it's your favorite client .
okay ... you get to sleep . i'll see you in the morning . good night .
sure i've been to the cotton club . it's pretty sweet . but it don't hold a candle to the boom boom room . that's where the real action is .
why do you work in that hideous insurance office ? - - dealing with people who fall off ladders . now take me - - i make my living as a stone mason . it's not my art - - but it's the <u> tools </u> of my art . you could be - - a journalist .
you missed somethin ' , ed .
hear she's retarded .
i can't remember doing anything wrong either .
i'm sure . when you've led the kind of life that i have , there are debts that must be paid . maybe i can balance the scales a little .
the mayor's office , under the bed , the back room at lombardi's . and call me ich .
that's up to you .
tell me about your adopted mother
i don't .
- - anna - -
that would presuppose a feeling , commander ... compassion . i sensed <u> no </u> emotion , only ...  ... pure logic .
nothing in moderation , clerval .
- - why don't you ask chuckie ?
my name's dorota , i'm jurek's sister . oh ! you're bleeding .
what kind of place is this ?
like what ?
all right . after they put you away ...
i don't drive cross country .
we make the pick-up , refuel once more in the bahamas , and fly back on sunday with the mom and pop traffic .
i beg your pardon .
sorry .
great .
i ... i love it . i haven't been there since i was a kid . but it's nearly two o'clock . i really should be getting back to whitehall and marks .
forgive me , your majesty . in no way did i wish to suggest - -
dr . weir , admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible .
i'm sorry , i - -
yeah - - this time you're gonna help !
it sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new .
i can't hardly believe it . camp i was in once , they burned it out--the deputies an ' some of them poolroom fellas .
take this mask . it may look like the empress , but it's not .
where are you , anyway ?
the other guy's a frog too . checked in at the edison . had a hooker sent up .
sam , i - i don't know where she is , okay ?
yes , i'm sorry .
no ! do as i say .
no , no , you're right , fry . what's to be afraid of ? my life is a steamin ' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow . so i say mush on ! canyon's only couple hundred meters , after that we're in skiff city ! so why don't you just butch up , stuff a cork in that kid , and get - -
oh .
- - way we could safely - -
i know . i know . i am sorry .
we do .
i'll see you back at the hotel .
innocent ? is that supposed to be funny ? look at the people i killed . an obese man , a disgusting man who could barely stand up ... who if you saw him on the street , you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you . who if you saw him while you were eating , you wouldn't be able to finish your meal . after him i picked the lawyer . and , you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one . this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster ... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets .
i'm so tired ...
i'm making the small buy tonight ... if i don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something . if everyone is happy , we'll do the big deal later in the week .
m'm .
yes - -
what about the zoo ?
then the thighs where they joined the torso .
because they're coming right at us .
you want me to come out there and play private eye ?
something maybe grew a size bigger .
i didn't know that . mine's still brown .
i started wondering - - if you couldn't switch back - - would it make a difference ?
duh .
my apologies , miss . as you were saying , before you were so rudely interrupted ?
just now . they want you to come down to his school .
give that back to me .
you don't seem to understand . anne doesn't expect anything from you .
oh hell yes .
he does , does he ? how did i treat you - - like a water buffalo ?
stop it ! they found the truck , kev ! they're already behind us !
yeah ? where ?
kind of a bad neighborhood , snake .
why don't you want to talk about it ?
these men you up under . how you let them do ya like that ?
what else is going on ?
so modest .
the national safety council would be appalled .
i forget mine for years on end .
don't worry , son , we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy .
i've learned that a man can only go so along living alone .
i'm afraid there's nothing more tonight , miss . unless you charter a plane .
i'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me . and that fuckin ' bartender sticks a weed up my ass , too .
no !
the rain ... sometimes it gives me the blues .
calvin , i insist i be allowed to capture it !
yeah ?
sherman , i've done lots of favors for you .
you follow directions good . now let's wrap this production . go to the sunrise studios backlot . i'll call you when you get there .

don't lie to me , hamilton ! if i had not court-martialed arnold ...
excuse me ?
sure .
when will you write me a sonnet , will ?
look ... don't throw that on me .
they might think i was running away from something .
no way .
no .
tell me , dr . watson , what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose .
need we go through it all again ?
no thanks . i'll take care of it . we've got a lot of shit to talk about .
hope not--if he is , he's dead . let's go to the newspaper office .
i saw sarah the other day .
yeah .
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack ?
yeah . knocked around for a couple of months after the army . you been there ?
i'm doing this for us .
i'll sleep in study hall , promise . i'd rather keep busy , you know ?
herr falkstein ! did you inform frederick frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place ?
i'm working on it .
yeah .
and how do you feel about that ?
you mean , outside ... with her .
everything .
that's my job . i'll take care of that . i'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me . but i can't do anything if you go around talking to people . will you promise me to be careful from now on ?
katrina ...
yeah ? what did they want ?
or teach it a better tune .
of course you do !
the ba'ku could use some rest , sir . according to the geo-scan , this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers ...
yes , it really causes problems . sometimes it's like you're in the same room . but if it's too much trouble , i understand ...
i don't know all about what happened back then . but it always stood between me and my husband .
i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring .
sally ? i was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave .
not possible .
you can--you have the " gotta " - -
no , i'm serious . you know what kurt potter is ? he's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place . he's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pg & e offered 20 million . he doesn't work like us , ed . there's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing .
you're not helping .
is that agent desmond's vehicle ?
according to you i'm a sexual failure . an animal , you said . you know now , don't you ?
we were all upset about that .
what's that ?
you shouldn't have put it in the show . this is the one i absolutely have to have . i really love it .
you sent for me ?
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed .
i don't know ... and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table .
well , that's alright . i understand you . now , say the whole thing again , hello ...
emma !
satisfied , wiseass ?
push on this side . alice , this is jack , marcie and ned . push .
am i in trouble ?
tremoille , i'm not even king yet ... who'd want to assassinate me ?
i just wanted to know where mom was ?
there are over 4 million people in this city - why me ?
i told you we had other stops to make tonight .
yes . but i got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
what's that ?
twenty-eight-point-five .
go ahead ...
okay , you got me , mr . pbs .
look , i appreciate , you know , the concern and all , but like he said , i can take care of myself .
cross my heart .
just you .
well , no , i don't see any way . and i know how hard it is for you to - - to lose this chance .
i had to tell someone . he put it into perspective .
it reminded me of you , so i bought it . it cost me more than all the others .
hey geraldine , let's eat !
is it about a pirate's daughter ?
what ? no menthol ?
top level review , my ass . there'll be no cover-up of this . not after i get ...
you expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring ? and you'll meet some french girl who can speak your own language . no thank you !
johnson & johnson . union carbide in japan . i was general manager and director of new products . i speak japanese . i was a director of corporate development at pfizer . all health-related . what else ? outside the " zone " ... ?
of course .
who am i talking to ?
follow me .
mary ! ready ? first bell's a-ringing !
they're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket . they're -
but you are an aristocrat and a slave owner . sir .
outside ?
up there .
no . i'm sure i've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance .
that's so beautiful ...
i feel as if i've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon . could you teach me to do that ?
open it !
my people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships , man . and there wasn't any statue in charleston harbor to welcome them , either . what are you , dana ?
if you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job - -
what ?
this is all too familiar .
no more tricks , edward . release chase and dick . this is between you and me .
no thanks .
you're not lying to me , are you ?
we better make it , or sport'll get mad . how do you want to make it ?
where's the rest of the team ?
well , the line's growing weaker , little brother . lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay .
like hell it is !
fred !
good - i've got to dash - say that i said hello to ellen for me would you ...
give me a fucking ...
elegant words , sir , when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip . in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock . i learned at the knee of the master .
you knew about me .
what are you bitching about now ?
or what , you'll authorize my death a second time today ?
get out .
no , forget it , it was stupid .
the park dude was missing an arm .
you mean like in the steam room ?
shelly ...
that's none of your fucking business .
okay . two of ' em . both had my father . it's peculiar . i'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years . so in a sense he's the younger man . anyway , first one i don't remember so well but it was about meetin ' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and i think i lost it . the second one , it was like we was both back in older times and i was on horseback goin ' through the mountains of a night .
tomorrow , he says .
such power exists ?
you son-of-a-bitch . how do you stop it ?
i've been thinking - -
dr . hirsch ?
at eleven at night ? _ 70 .
i don't anymore .
i drink . a couple of occasions more than i should have . i was cited for shoplifting once . but it was a mistake ... i pushed liane one time . we were both stressed out because of the pressure . she went to her mother's . i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself . and i don't like to be pushed around !
that's exactly what we don't have , doctor .
no . women're always followin ' me ' round .
<u> dr . acula </u> !
no ! ... i'm fine . thank you .
uh well hey , let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts i dug up . now , prepare to be a little disappointed .
which one of you is what ?
of course . jack campbell . i went to high school with you ... you played baseball , right ? youre doing well ...
did you tell him you were leaving ?
gosh , i could kill you , but then you'd miss my party . and you , batman - - you're the guest of honor !
i'm listening , joanna--believe me , i'm listening . my wife is walking out on me after eight years of - -
- - yes , we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in , believe it or not .
gimme the address . i'm gonna go . we're going to need her .
sadly , no . and i find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend . what do you think ?
wow , you were " in the joint . " " doing hard time . " it's funny , but that excites me . i seem to have a thing for sinners .
yes .
that's very funny , that is .
let's get out of here .
i was .
may i ask your name ?
want to swim home ?
yeah .
i have a bond receipt for you to sign .
talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . i handed it to him on a silver platter . i told my father and those people ...
right now , i'm more worried about my mother than anything . they won't let her see my father .
this and that .
christy . christy van cartier .
i'll get it if you want .
oh , i know . if i had to work here all day , i'd be bloated and out of shape , too .
pro boner ? pro bono , huh ? for whose good , supposedly ?
suein hwang and milo geyelin .
ow ! no , it's okay . it's better tight .
sometimes i forget .
thanks .
so , what's the topic of discussion ?
no . this has been going on for some time . several months . about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river . they were from people who were reported missing . they never found one complete body . only parts .
well , let's see what we get .
what ?
to do business .
you're my girl , aren't you ?
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid .
if you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea - -
aye , i do , peter .
about tonsils .
sir ?
you all are gonna fuckin ' die ! i'm gonna fuckin ' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit !
you don't like the tune , find another station .
... and he was hunting the first one , this one . wasn't he ? wasn't he ? this one was running , the other one was hunting him ...
well , i see it still smells like pine needles in here .
they tore her dress ! ...
my , my--you sho ' are pahwerfully upset , mister mcgann--but you ' awfully cute .
you killed my jody
what's the idea of telling me you just knew the wolfe girl by sight ?
i know .
the water was dripping , see ... i turned it off , but it was still dripping , and then auggie had to go out , and so i left the back room ... and later on ... well , later on ... when auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded . his cuban cigars got all messed up ... you know , soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits ...
what ! you can't be - -
who the hell is this " they ? "
wait , betty ... you still haven't answered me .
after we eat , dad .
i already explained about that .
you need my help ... ? you need a goddamn keeper ... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand ? huh ... ? are you nuts ? eh ? are you nuts . what are you going to do , bring her back to life ?
there's no question you'll be friends . of course you'll be friends .
sis . let me take care of you for once .
i need you to tell me what you remember . what happened to us ?
you're completely reliable .
tell ' em to hold the wire .
then you must allow me to stay close to you so that - -
i've heard the carpenters before . chick drummer and freaky dude . not unlike the white stripes .
oh . it's fine . what's another ten pounds ?
yes .
found another note , same thing , no name , no signature . " when you receive this , i will be quite dead , so no answer will be possible . i offered you love . all i got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth . "
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ?
it can't all be like this ...
i flinched .
i never mentioned the word before . in his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table .
your roller-skates ! i redesigned them ! i think this new design will work even better !
floris , you're very nice , but i'm afraid im in love with somebody else .
that's a - - that's a pretty big slice . who do you think you are , general motors ?
that's where i live . and i want to get back there so badly i'm going all the way to emerald city to get the wizard of oz to help me .
it's a wall you bought in china , mr . kane .
see anything ?
i don't care what you wanted to tell me . you're through ! get your things and get out !
it's not something for nothing , george , i took you in on this , you have to go . that's your thing . i've made the deal with graff . i can't go . i can't go in , i've spoken on this too much . i've got a big mouth . " the fucking leads " et cetera , blah blah blah " ... the fucking tight ass company ... "
then what are you trying to say then ?
the university computer is down for maintenance , but i've been going through my own notes ...
he's over at the boat show . he'll be by later . it's so beautiful here .
i don't want to discuss it .
shhh . hold it down ! i'll take you guys down , but ya gotta come right back up ! ' kay ?
what's the pay ?
i'm sure , i'm positive it didn't happen the way jack says it did .
yeah .
i ... i don't think so .
sir , yes , sir !
how do you know that ?
it's just the shock of seeing me after three years . believe me , you'll get over it .
thought you swore you'd never carry that thing again .
that's how you get to know someone . did it hurt when you got it ?
shut the fuck up , donny . we'll , uh , brace the kid--he'll be a pushover . we'll get that fucking money , if he hasn't spent it already . million fucking clams . and yes , we'll be near the , uh--some burgers , some beers , a few laughs . our fucking troubles are over , dude .
dee . god damn it . i told you to go home .
two cases . and dinner when you land .
out for the evening ?
please , maya . i'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense .
yes . it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride . do you know what that means ?
what broke <u> you </u> free , girl ?
i think i heard that .
upstairs and downstairs in his night gown - - he could be saying the house he's picked is two stories .
my name is barry egan and i spoke to you ... you called me , you remember ?
well , i'm sure as hell not what i thought i was gonna be . i was supposed to have one of those great lives , with everything all laid - out and perfect . i mean , hell - - i was miss wichita , for god's sakes . did i tell you that ? you live next door to a real live beauty queen . i still got the tiara . i kept it cause i thought it meant something . i thought it meant i was gonna do something great with my life . i thought it proved i was gonna grow up to be someone .
hi , welcome back to the ' world of the psychic , ' i'm peter venkman and i'm chatting with my guest , author , lecturer and of course , psychic , milton anglund . milt , your new book is called the end of the world . isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease . yes , it could happen , but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it ?
what's that got to do with it ?
you don't have to do it for a living .
i was asked by my father to open neg -
sometimes .
looking for a scoop , huh ? i'll give you a scoop ... of short bus . lose her !
downstairs . there must be an extension . oh my god - -
please , can i have one to surge with ?
they're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard . they'd be better off letting it move on .
hey what's with you ? i thought you were cool . you rode my bike . you blew some pot . what's your scene miss majorette ? you gonna marry mr . blue impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life ?
i'm a banker , friend . that's legit in this state .
good morning , mr . treves . it'll be his bath-time soon . has he eaten ?
alright ?
oh hello , where's dickie ? how are you ?
we commend the soul of our brother departed . we love we commit his body to the depths of space .
he's dead , you bitch .
where's the girl ? miss stone .
that was beaumont .
obviously ...
be quiet !
what are these , beauty marks ?
claire , listen to me . i know you're under some strain . but there's no such thing as ghosts . they don't exist . our neighbor did not kill his wife , and i ... wait , why aren't you dressed ?
i don't know . probably out . want something to drink ?
should we scramble tachq for an intercept ?
oh , yes .
bad ?
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary , major ?
you're delusional . maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip - - so you tasted blood . and the severed arm ... well i don't see it and ... maybe this is all in your head .
i'm linda lee .
i have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed ... and by god , it shall be done !
oh , god ...
i don't know
oh - i've found plums . we have plums in the orchard . we have an orchard ! she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth .
well , we'd better hurry if we're going to see the wizard !
gotta wait til the press conference .
i'll see ya around , huh ?
yeah ?
so , i come across the hospital convoy i was looking for this stuff , and some nurse , mary , hana's friend , tells me about you and hana , hiding in a monastery , in purdah , whatever it is - retreat - how you'd come in from the desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - - a copy of herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings , and then i knew it must be you .
mr . kessler ?
rat gizzards . they smell bad and taste worse , but that's the best the desert has to offer .
stop freaking with her head man . just stop playing with her mind , you know ? she's a human being . she's a person . she's very talented , you know .
you told me . when you called you said she was in the other room . drop the knife .
yeah ...
theories ?
lotta water .
wait . slow down . a film like this , 16mm , cost two three hundred dollars , sold outright , shown in peep machines , maybe theatres , maybe not , is almost impossible to track . ' nobody ' makes it ; ' nobody ' shows it ; ' nobody ' sees it . it's like it doesn't even exist .
master ching taught me .
you ought to see my backhand . and wait till i serve the meatballs .
believe it .
yes , ed .
i know you knew i'd know .
sure .
clearly , yes comrade .
anyway , he offered me a silver cloud . at least he should give me a ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something ...
actually , it's very admirable , the way she works . she'll probably be enormously successful , because she's attractive as well , not that that's so important in music , but ...
zack , when you're through with a girl , what do you do ? do you say something or do you just ... disappear ?
not like your fuckin ' friends out there , that ... without brains . okay ?
we've got another two hours of daylight .
cap'n ... ?
yes , quite .
what good will that do ?
could i run a tube through that wall , without harming benes ?
hey , i don't care about tommy como . i don't care about jesus christ on the fuckin ' cross . i gotta give them a percentage of what i make ! i'm in here breaking my ass , not them . don't ever bring them up here again .
yeah . my brother told me .
she stole my car ! !
i was wondering , if you're not doing anything tonight ... would you like to go to dinner ? i know ; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless , would you ?
good idea . flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises . go too low , one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it .
that's okay .
satellites ?
i think that's about the time i fell asleep .
no . course not .
maybe someday you'll tell me your name .
you can see me now .
hey , folklore - -
great .
oh , yeah . how do i look ? older , huh ?
i didn't give ' em the m -
it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then . i call him smedley . his real name is frankie jenkins - but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering " frankie ! " .. where is this leading to , mr . garrison ?
that piece of shit . workin ' with the cops .
yeah . me and a friend of mine . he's outside .
shall we adjourn ?
this was taken when richter was arrested in washington state , 1985 . he was charged with interstate arms trafficking , skipped bail , and has since been a fugitive .
so he's alive ?
there is more to love than he knew , or that you know .
not at all ... i understand perfectly , count d'algout gave you a dog . you made it very clear , madame .
i hear you . i'll stay in touch .
so , let me get this straight . you came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you .
no .
have no idea what ordinary people thought .
really . what are you writing about .
i caught up with lednov in nogales . he didn't like the idea of comin ' back across the border but he came . i turned him over to the sheriff and - - that's the story .
the guy is super cool ! his name is mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar . i actually hung out with him today .
dad , when i called the machine to check our messages there was one from bethel baptist . mr . franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back . he said when we come home , if you still feel the same way - -
if you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system . then , if you move fast enough , stay ahead of ' em ... without bein ' able to signal each other , they might have a hard time catchin ' you .
so why didn't you do it ?
merle , i wanna go home !
why can't i go out to your folks ' house ? give me one good reason .
the truth is , the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public . john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense .
my spy network has heard no such news .
those trees were very young when i first arrived .
... you know , chauncey ... i want us to be ... i want us ... you and i to become ... close ... i want us to become very close , you know ... ?
ma che cazzo !
suppose he's holding a grudge ?
nobody else , but i've been through that stuff of walter thatcher's . that journal of his -
thank you , jimmy .
jad . how come you're not out there with father witwer ?
hi honey .
railroad burned him out too . you couldn't have stopped him .
exactly . replaces the baton , gives steve the case .
no identification at all . what're you thinkin ' , cecil ?
whatta ya mean , boss ?
oh come on , that's ridic -
i kept trying to call you after my divorce and tom always said you were busy . when i got the wedding invitation i knew you weren't sore at me anymore , godfather .
i believed her , pete .
darling , did you bring the insect repellent lotion ?
fine , thank you .
we're all here , bill - -
so are you . i mean you're a neat guy . we better get back .
i put it down the garbage disposal .
because there's no way a girl could have killed them .
ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future ?
a piece of ass wouldn't kill me .
i think i've heard of you .
dr . bright , i don't have to do anything .
i guess not .
you make me sick . i can't believe you've sunk so low .
where do you eat ?
how ya think , it hurts like a son-of - a-bitch .
they're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe .
no .
forget it ! c'mon let's go to the pool .
it certainly is . i agree with you completely .
so you have claimed . yet you have no explanation for this . the locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder . the locket you so coveted . how did it come to be in your possession ?
why did you help me ?
well , come on !
oh , nothing . he is crazy , that's all . i had a little trouble with him .
she's got to meet you -
way too late . buzz fazeli is history . too late for what ?
i'll be back .
you'll be better off without me . i ain't fit to live with no more . it's just like a lynchin ' . maybe they don't use a knife on you , but they got other ways .
so , fine , it's not that the jew , the jews own the media and the banks . it's that they're sexually corrupt .
well , well ! if it isn't my old friend ! turn around , gal ! let's get a look at you .
how much is the lemon meringue pie ?
that's true ... your soldier knew , didn't he ?
how can they ? who else is there ? i have no heir ...
... could i get you to call loretta and tell her i've gone to odessa ? goin ' to visit with carla jean moss .
mm hm ... two ball , side pocket .
what's in it ?
can i come ? i'll start a fire ...
its horrors , perhaps ! its darkest nightmares ! and to what end ? nothing but your own morbid gratification - -
i wouldn't have come if i had known that you were here . believe me , rick , it's true . i didn't know .
the pages are gone . that's real .
how have you ... ?
huh !
what's wrong ?
andrew was a kind and gentle man , but he was thirty years older than her . where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that - - to have the kind of sex they had .
you got it , g . g .
they're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay , even if that's all they hear .
yes . your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting .
this is a real piece of shit .
yeah , i know . it always takes a little time to make new friends .
do you know him well ?
where're you going ?
it won't open .
ah . ah . ah ...
the thalamus and the hypothalamus , perhaps ?
no ? then what did he say ?
oh , jesus .
i know that's what you'd like us to believe . but i got to tell you - - embezzlement is a serious matter . not to mention abduction .
i detest comparisons made with oil .
man , fuck you ! ! !
who ?
twelve-fifteen .
what died tonight inside that room was not that woman . it will take her many nights to die , perhaps yeaars . what has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human .
i gotta go out for a while .
you'll learn .
that's nice . and you live in queens ? with a child , and a dog ... ?
horticulture ? wow . i didn't know there was a college here .
i made this place ... now listen to me . i'll get out of this room , we have bigger troubles than this ...
nobody <u> lives </u> on this lake . it's really <u> his </u> lake now .
since his beard was red .
no .
i think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way i think . i came down here to get away from all that .
nothing . just that if i was less secure , i might think you were more into eleanor than you are me ...
how do i know you are cops ?
you didn't have to ...
with a woman who is completely charming , be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition , and who , regardless of her rank , will show me some kindness , tonight .
i was an indian , actually . man , that damn psycho paint ... ! if that's supposed to be mild , i don't want to know about medium . the planet earth . it's good to be back .
i can't get sick . you know - - training and all . i'm gonna be late .
... what ?
shhh ! be quiet , man ! we're not alone -
i'm sorry , i'm just surprised to see you . i didn't think ... what do you want ?
she must have been in love with you .
but we want you back , bill . mean - while , enjoy your party , celebrate , we'll attend to the nasty details . and mr . black , may we say thank you .
not one i should like to rely on . francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after austerlitz , and he is under great pressure to recover his losses .
drink .
neither do i ... ha ha ho ho hee hee .
what's takin ' so long over there ?
... be back .
they're trying to kill me !
well , fortunately , i carry my own .
down the drainpipe . i didn't mean to shoot him . you believe me , don't you , mollie ?
that fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill , which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me .
she isn't ?
what is ?
right .
i don't know .
just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship , that's all .
of course you are .
... to let this happen !
the porter is going to talk to us tonight .
i don't understand .. reveal yourself to me !
your tissue , your organs , your entire biophysical structure is changing . every system is still functioning , somehow - -
that's our reserve air .
no , i don't wanna come -
burgel doesn't like anybody !
of course it was . anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do , is bound to get a little flak here and there . you try flogging the stories on cnn i've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days . at any rate , it's been most instructive - - what they'll swallow , or what they'll broadcast with a straight face . miss hall's blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus . not even antibodies .
that's perfectly clear .
how did it go ?
i like all of them - -
that's it .
set to the poem of yetveshenko !
bingo !
only one way you can help me . you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you ?
actually , i ... i don't . what does that mean ?
hey man , don't you have something else you could put it in ?
you're crazy - -
long ago . now there is nothing : the men killed each other in family vendettas ... the others escaped to america .
you're a detective , with no clues . where else are you going to look ? i'm going to keep this brief . here's thirty thousand dollars .
it's not a bad place . warm . great view .
tomorrow , we'll cut out your tongue .
yeah , just a nip . i feel like hell , all the carryings-on next door .
okay . never argue with a man .
well , i'm a working girl , mr . gittes . i didn't come in to see you on my own .
hey , hey , hey !
... pete . come on .
he cared enough to want you to have it .
is he an enemy ?
that's it . we're ready .
oh , it's a laugh a line with lennon . anyroad up ... it's all your fault .
hey . have a nice time - - it's a good school .
like you couldn't believe .
it was a very emotional time for buttercup - -
me ?
congratulations . by crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach - infested carpet , you've become the third white man ever to hear of it .
same thing he wanted in prague ! same thing he's always wanted ! the noc list !
what ? ! are you mentally deranged , jam ?
ah . that's what i was going to do .
what was her name ?
if it will make you feel any better , i don't have a gun .
now i remember . annette harrison . your father's the new headmaster at oakwood .
... sally ?
nothing like a little cheery news to start the day .
i won't - - - - if you won't tell what * i * done !
i can whack people . i'm hell at whacking .
that's it , i'm goin ' ...
okay ! it's under my desk ! ! taped to the bottom side ! ! !
all right ! a little higher ! just a little higher !
where are the men without skin ?
give me back my anonymity , that's all i ask ! let me be invisible again !
if they don't take me out before then . [ as an afterthought ] what's the net ?
hey , this one's mine , this button . this one , you rem -
does that look to you like about a ' 77 ford , wendell ?
every valuable item in the house was on that list .
hana , we have discovered a shared please - the boy and i .
simple math . when i woke up this morning and saw your smile ... i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you .
fine .
where's your mother tonight , plato ?
fucking australians ! i hate that country , continent , what is it ? don't we do nuclear testing there ?
pain ? pain is just a state of mind . it's something you learn to live with . i have .
you know , we know each other .
nope . not handsome at all .
when i get home i shall probably be knighted for it .
it's taken care of .
a coup d'etat ?
charlie , i'm from the old country , and these american ways get me sometimes confused . you tellin ' us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses ?
yeah , i noticed you limping . but don't worry about it , brah . don't worry at all . we're not gonna land on land !
yes ... they were .
just across the bay , at the fuel depot . the men wanted to try to get home . i can't explain .
there's a dead body in the exhibit ! people are panicking , trampling each other trying to get out .
i'm working across on a cattle boat .
i want to fly jets , sir !
- - please , get away from me .
that's your dream , homes . not mine . i don't want to leave this street . ever . the status quo is totally cool with me .
we're trying to get there . i hope we can .
huh ? i ... uh ... uh ...
agatha , you're never going back there .
i'm here on behalf of the crew , sir .
now wait a minute ...
not much .
only one young boy ever drowned in that lake , and that was before you were even born . his name was jason voorhees .
what do you think it's like ?
kasimov , kasimov , good that you called us .
gibberish , my friend . he rants and he raves - -
you are spoiling me too much . i won't know what to do with myself when you've gone .
no .
the fight's set - - i don't need a manager .
let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential , and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the tribunal . you may proceed , dr . honorius .
oh , boy ! what a yarn ! what a yarn ! get me hank on the phone . gotta hold up the morning edition .
you were ? i thought you were chasing me ?
okay , i guess .
and what were the consequentialities of european culture you didn't bother with ?
not a man . ezekiel walters .
born and bred .
to throw out of the window .
you are slovenly and unattractive and i won't t-t-t-tolerate it .
on the contrary , your eminence . it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross .
i waited to get your autograph , but you never came outside .
yeah .
spirits have a way of bringing that out .
you know you almost got us both killed back there ?
every day in every way .
i ... can't .
why should i trust you ?
we are betraying the principles upon which the federation was founded ... this is an attack on the very soul of the federation . this will destroy the ba'ku . just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history .
gladly , only i don't know what you want ! you haven't told me .
shutup ! - - after all ! you haven't talked to me for a week and now i'm going to say my piece . i've got a prediction for you , norville barnes : i predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad , you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you . you're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you ... if you ...
well , i think windows stink . what do you think of that ?
do you realize how immoral this all is ?
what's going on ?
and that's why you both lead the gang . two of you went into that bank together , right ?
nothing .
what's that for ?
the night before the shooting .
yeah .
where's your program ? won't it miss you ?
sounds like a pirate .
the religion the almighty and me worked out betwixt us .
your home address is 18 thornton avenue , coventry .
he was very good . better than some people would think .
i'll take that under consideration , your honor .
i'm through with you .
twice i took the name of god in vain , once i slept with the brother of my fianc , and once i bounced a check at the liquor store - - but that was really an accident .
oh yes ! who could forget . afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte .
very well .
look , tran ... lenny just came by to give me some bad news . an old friend of mine has been murdered . you remember iris ?
y'know how i got started in the fight racket ?
carl ? ? ? carl did this ? ! !
more than you need me .
v'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe , thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions . to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension ; v'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator .
listen , i'm coming over . don't go anywhere . stay right there .
forget it . i've already spent too many hours crying over you .
he was so excited - - when he got the stamps you gave him this morning . he said he had never seen any like them .
if you were truly a copycat , wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could ?
meet you in the lobby . okay ?
what kind of an act is this ?
i was going to remind you of nothing , least of all that which you know well . your mistake , if i may be so bold , was promotion . commanding a starship is your first best destiny . anything else is a waste of material .
i didn't want him meeting me here .
- - please , baby - -
i think i'll keep that to myself . which way are the rooms ?
ditto for the swooping swallow .
i'm eleven and a half .
no--inexperienced - - a red-headed kid--homemade clothes--broadway was paradise--and a slot at the automat was a banquet .
he shall be endured
i need the job .
it is clearly federation in origin , captain .

i thought you were someone else
they , uh , they got to my witness .
there aren't any women here .
i'm sure you mean that to be comforting , but -
it's like strip poker , only , without the bluffing . one person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true , the one who says it , gets to take one item of clothing off .
anung-un-rama ...
separately , we are flawed and vulnerable . but together , we are the masters of our sexual destiny !

a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears , asking for comfort , comfort because she was too old to have any children . not that she wanted to , but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility .
except for one little thing .

i think it's very sensible in the circumstances .

so that's where you are . i might of known it . no wonder you couldn't hear me .
we try to be decent .
turn that thing off , will you ? it's driving me nuts ! what's rosebud ?
sure you know , son , but i think you've been having a little problem with it . it's okay , though . what you're doing is perfectly normal . it's like practice . like when you play tennis against a wall . some day , there'll be a partner returning the ball . you do want a partner , don't you son ?

if title dictated my behavior , as a clerk serving the public , i wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy . but i did , so my point is that people dictate their own behavior . hence , even though i'm a clerk in this video store , i choose to go rent videos at big choice . agreed ?

true .
all right ! don't take them off . do whatever you please . but shut up about it .

she has the face of an angel ... she was an angel . she was so kind ... so kind to me . it's not her fault , for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant . i'm sure i must have been a great disappointment to her .

the last i heard , a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breed's hill . with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it .
no , slink - -
you've got a lot to lean about homicide , jeff . morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them . that salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner , toss her in a trunk and put her in storage .

he'd want to know about all this .
maya ? haven't seen her . i think she's off tonight . say , where's your buddy ?
checking in ... karla wilson .
then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure .

this should have bled by the pint . yet , no blistering or scorched flesh . how ... ? whatever weapon was used ... it cauterized somehow ...
what ?
a steak , please . rare . mother , i need to ...
no ... the door's too thick .
why ?
but what you were doing ?
we're on .
why ? because i give a shit ?
pritchett , what is this " core of darkness " ?
ezra , i'm lots better than you're used to . tell me - - the other night , watching me with mr . faber - - wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out ?
no ...
awww , it's just been a shitass day . every inch of it hot and miserable . first off , nadine at the blue chip got some sorta sick , so that mongoloid boy of hers was workin ' the grill . that fuckin ' idiot don't know rat shit from rice krispies . i ate breakfast at nine , was pukin ' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty .
what the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money ?

don't be ridiculous !
you'd have been proud of her .
old thorpey ? haven't seen him in a long time .
i beg your pardon ?

one question : do they have a sheet on you , where you told him you're from ?
you're not having lunch ?
getting to what ?
i know .
he got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote ' em a fucking check . like that , fifty mil , signed his name . whoa - - little help here !
but what can we do ? she don't know who's visiting her ...
no , dave , i wasn't .
are you trying to give us away ? for somebody with such a big brain , you think awfully small .
she got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone ... but me , i'm different . sometimes she need the real deal , so she call me up . girl got an itch . you know ... what's a nigga to do ?
you left your back wide open . freeze could have killed you .
he can handle the work , he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you .
no , it's not .
we got separated right away . i never knew how many made it .
walter , you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way . now , would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for ?
the driveway's on my side of the house .
great . donovan actually said the words " good work , ms . woods " . he takes me seriously ! can you believe it ?
no ! i would never cheat you .
eh . fuck it .
well , i'm stuck with two and twobut i'm a sucker if i can make four out of it . where do you come in ?
there's something else which i know will appeal to you . a visit to the paris sewers . they tell me it is extremely instructive .
just one ? christ ... i hope it's appropriate .
you talked to your supervisor lately ? he's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight . that on top of the cops bugging him .
yeah .
you can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary .
" painted " ?
yes . samuel ! we're going .
i don't think so . but it's a fascinating subject . did you ...
huh ?
no way ! the whole enchilada in one shot .

it's gone . the file's not here . what did you do ?
isn't that your own fault ?
but i got you out . didn't i , doc . i did it . i got you out .
can't , sistah .
you're supposed to be my doctor , right ?
then why do you persist in doing it ?
salute .
i'm finished with swayzak . i'll do whatever you want me to do . i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim . you gotta give me another shot .
you said someone killed them , you said you know who , you said that .
good ? good , paulie ? ! i've been treatin ' you like a baby . since i can't remember it's so long - - i'm the only one who feeds you an ' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up - - and it's you that made me feel like a loser - - that's what ya use to call me ' loser ' - - what kind of name is that ? so can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when i'm with rocky - - i don't owe you , paulie , you owe me .
i don't understand any of that .
how ' bout you ?
get everyone in hell ready . when the blood of terrance and phillip spills , the day is ours !
you know what kind of woman grace is . you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of sierra . what makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you ? what's she to you , jake ; a woman who would have you dead ? let me kill her . all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
okay . you're not a team player . you gotta do things your own way . fine . nail this guy and make us all look good . but you better watch your ass . if you screw up , i can promise you , you're goin ' down .
god , think about that ... that's actually totally depressing .
and likewise .
i'm not hungry . you two just enjoy yourselves . after all , this is a celebration .
too bad !
tell me what everyone doesn't know .
let him go or i will deliver you , right now .

where's the body ?
judge wakefield , it's an honor to handle it for you . consider it gone away . she's a minor ; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway .
you can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak .
i'm sorry . i'm sorry .
why do you do it if it hurts so bad ?
betty , i don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison . no way . i've got some professional pride . and i don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out .
it's alright , baby .
tick . not to dash your hopes , but i don't deal this kind of product , you know that . i'll give you four for it , cause i've gotta cut off the last bit . and my customers want uncut .

once it's spent you won't have to worry about it .
you load the film ... ? no , on this side ... or this side ? don't move the baby !
i gotta talk to me partner first . we can't afford to expose our game too much .
i've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now .
yeah , but i ain't got time to spend the money i make here .
these girls , kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder . the oldest is twelve . the youngest about the same age you were when you escaped .

maxie's fucking with me . he put you with the spook to get under my skin .
now lookit , dorothy , you ain't using your head about miss gulch . think you didn't have any brains at all .
i'd l-like to answer the question .
you don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make " friends " .
i'm not going !
i think you ought to know what our chances are . the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing : finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane , but who didn't have fish for dinner .
but i'll tell you , he knew how to bring in the crowds . he knew all the fuckin ' angles . he brought over the whole ' femme fatale ' show from paris . but he forgot how lazy them european dancin ' broads can get . i mean , he had to weigh ' em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin ' balloons .
i'll get you close .

at six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic .
i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons . he and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other . but she had this huge weight problem . his friends taunted him mercilessly about it . you know , " how do you breathe when she sits on your face ? " " it's embarrassing for you to be seen with her . " finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her . she flipped and he went on the defensive . i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again . " i'm completely fucked up . " " i'm completely fucked up . " " i'm completely fucked up . " poor fatty never had a chance .
oh , if there is only time !
professor tripp ?
oh , i understand , all right . i've been understanding since i was seventeen . and the next step is , as long as you're going to see me tomorrow , why don't you stay the night .
rudolfo , you dirty pig ! pull over .
. . . what ?
so there is only one key ...
basically , i'm completely smitten with you , and i don't care if i'm making an ass out of myself right now , because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times , and you still want to be my friend .
hey , just tell me where the fuck you want us to go .
he told me they knew i was coming here .

i got my own ... <u> quest </u> to pursue up here . it's crucial i not get sidetracked , with some silly ...
oh , no , that's the style . it's meant to be clinging .
no way to know . without more tests , experiments .
well , let's spit on it .
so what are you thinking ?
you're breaking my ribs !
dad i'm kidding , you can have the room .
god in heaven , what is that ? !
can you marylin ? can you return the trust ? can you return the hopes ? the dreams ? can you just ... send it all back for store credit ?
diet coke .

what about me ?
just me , i suppose ... i'm restless . i can't help it .
can i take your picture ?
maybe i won't .
you have to . it's a tradition .
yes .
please . because i love you . he stares at her , sees the pleading look in her eyes , and lets go . she turns and walks away toward the church , slowly , her head bowed . he watches her go and starts to move after her . then slowly , as she goes , her head begins to go up until finally , as she walks , she is staring high above her . and then , suddenly , she breaks into a broken run .
trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected .
i need some help . i do . i need some help . you gotta help me . i need a new sponsor , nicky .
we've worked up several military scenarios . before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options , i'd like for us to adopt a rule . if we are going to strike , we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational . because once they are , i don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched .
didn't ... ahhh ... look good .
poor ninotchka . poor , poor ninotchka .
how'd the show go ?
keep moving !
do you ever pray ? you know ... believe in a supreme being ?

no . my mother .
your father ?
i duped these prints off him . can you run an i . d . ?

come on in .
what if ?
they're your favorite flower .
i think you're swell company , knott .
doesn't it worry you ?
no .
hey , you're gonna piss me - - what the hell are you supposed to be ...
i'm sorry he's dead , but ... have you signed off yet ?
well ... the very first thing we're gonna do ... is get us a couple of six packs of lucky lager and climb up on toppa ' that famous hollywood sign and howl at the moon ...
okay , he's on base . can we talk about my life now ? - - ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal - - that i was never serious about gill , blah blah . he's totally out to get me .
for many months , i've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... and naturally , i am under the illusion that i know you somewhat . you never seemed the type , kader , inclined to performing useless actions .
i tried to call , but apparently there's something wrong ...
we ~ re oetting hammered , jason . return fire ?
c'mon , ray , everyone hates the army during basic . i'll tell you straight , i hated it here .
what did i do ?
call it a passion . i've got to get going .
bullshit .
two words .
to show that we're negotiating .
not even daddy ... or mommy ?
i was going to play golf . you were going to have asian girlfriends .
i just can't sleep at night . exploding department stores keep me up . one ...

you're not going to take off on me , are you ?
hey , murph .

derek !
a few more moments , still in this business . then i'd find you .
what do you think ?
sir , i know it was wrong . i didn't learn from one mistake and i made another , sir . sir , my family ... my whole family was in buenos aires , sir .
harry s . truman ?
not here ... alone . please .
when you make sense i'll listen .
i have to go , sam .
nothing further , your honor .
there's nothin ' to know . you have an idea , you write down what you wanna say . then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong , if you aren't positive yourself . maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words ... although i've seen scripts where i know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all . so i don't think it's too important . anyway , you come to the last page you write in ' fade out ' and that's the end , you're done .
wonderful . ran into a convention of auto dealers at the drake hotel . you hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to mars after two years ? his wife's got a year old kid . so he says " all right . who was it ? my friend harry ? " she says no . " oh , it was my friend sammy . " she says it wasn't sammy . " oh , i suppose it was my friend lou . " " no , what's the matter , don't you think i have any friends of my own ? ! "
you'll end up like me .
exactly . the instruments to go with the voices . trumpets and timpani , tonic and dominant .
it's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--i mean--in case i act sort of strange--it's the suit .
go back to the drawing board .
i wondered about your different accents . i'm still wondering about your names - - rand and holland .
i've got a new agenda now , it's get rich . the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all .

chris , can you do me a favour ?
it's fenner .
<u> ow </u> . shit .

young male intern , tall and handsome

my therapist said that - -
i wanna know your thinking , i wanna know how someone like you thinks . did you think you could get away with it , did you think you could put something over on me ? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them ? maybe that's your idea of being anti establishment !

james ... do you remember ... six years ago ... you had a phone number ! you tried to call and ...
you're not going to like it in chicago . they wind comes howling in from the lake . and there's practically no opera season at all - and the lord only knows whether they've ever heard of lobster newburg -
i'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out . - - you've been really sweet . sleep tight , okay ?
yes , i believe that's right . now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure , the victim becomes infectious . highly infectious .
she just called . she doesn't even know . it's probably the last time i'll ever hear her voice . that's weird , isn't it ? you spend christmas at somebody's house , you know , and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe , and ... i dunno ...
are you an epileptic ?
now i'm sorry . i appreciate your efforts . but i don't need anybody to help me button my pants - i've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right , and i can button ' em with one hand as a matter of fact .
they've never caught him before , what makes you think they'll catch him now ?
alright . they bother me once in awhile . tell me , when pop had troubles ... did he ever think , even to himself , that he had gone the wrong way ; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family , that he could ... that he could ... lose it instead ?

hm-mm ... hm-mm ...
we haven't build shit . you're just tearing down your father .
frank told me about your situation . and frank loves company . you know , especially after his daddy passed and all . there ain't no sense in you stayin ' in that old greasy shop . he's mentally retarded , poor thing .
delacroix , wake up , brother man . the reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and i mean nobody - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk .

i didn't do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .
your majesty .
george is great but i know what you mean .
she told you exactly what you needed to hear . that's all . sooner or later , neo , you're going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path .
i can see this is useless .
all right ... where did you see her ?
i'm not doing any tutoring this year . i'm too busy .
i can't take this no more . back and forth , back and forth .
jasmine ... do you have yesterday's show on tape , by any chance ?
no , i was going to give it to her - - but she left hurriedly .
the bedroom .
what are you serving ?
no .
mom , stop with this already . of course i love you . you're my mother .
i must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein , mr . kane .
who's got him ?

you could have had it done . you didn't want us there .
it's ok , it's alright . i'll come right back , i'll just go pay for my car .
i thought you would have some ideas .

you bet , terrance !
i've always wanted to meet you , captain .
see if you've been making it with my mother .
i knew . i rescued you , didn't i ? from the terrible dawn .
yes . you wouldnt know where i could reach him ? we had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my paris gallery , you see ? i really need to see him before i leave .
why not ?
i don't want to go to jail for this .
lick me .
what'd they call her in high school ?
where's my insurance policy ? oh , here . . .
good shape for an old man , eh ?
oh - here and there - and around .
i'll get us out of here .
you know why , don't you ? because i am patient , chain-smoking lillian .
jones ... come with me . cobb , you and doc check the rooms .
<u> shit </u> . someone beat us here .
god ! i've never seen anything like that in my whole life ! did you see that guy's nose ?
see , if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense .
look , i wasn't serious about you taking sam , so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it .
evolution has made you a clown - - with a cigar . simple butchers like you are obsolete !
ohhhhhhhhh , how i hate you .
where to first ?
red or white ?
i had no choice . some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac .
i was worried about you . did you hear about the bash ?
hello , grant . good to see you again .
i said , <u> whose number do you need </u> ?
hello , halberstam . nice tie . how the hell are you ?
is it safe for them here ?
you're kidding ?
you're going to be late !
i think i will .

how is this , sir ?
something to do with helen , is what i'm getting .

no . i'm a gardener .
so , we must face china and all her might alone .
and what happens if we say no ?
the stiff one eye ?
yep ?
but , i didn't ask him to kill .
he wasn't lying about marco : he's thirty stories down on the street . the other man is heinrich , and i found his body upstairs . and his bag is missing .
my name's sophia .
c'mon , just do it .
the army thinks he was killed in action by the germans , but i think they did it - - tex , gideon and scobie - - and your husband - - because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold . i think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him . i'm trying to prove it . they think i'm working with them . but i'm not , and that's the truth . i'm on your side , reggie - - please believe that .
is she running treadstone ?
sign up .
what is it ?
four ? there are five .
no , no , it's my fault . i've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own .
- so i watched europe . once you showed up in england .. it was easy .
so you need my help ? oh my g-d , this is like asking me for help with your homework . hey , mink , c'mere !
only one sure way to find him - - offer him a little something to eat . chum - - blood , waste meat , fish , anything . they can sense it miles away . if he's out there , we might be able to get a closer look at him . it's a good time , too . they're night feeders ...
please ... forgive me .
yes indeed .
otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute . of course , if my information as to your gains is incorrect , i'll dip my beak just a little . just a little , but no less than one hundred dollars , and don't try to deceive me , eh paisan ?
i didn't see that much of it - - same as now . i only saw it as part of my own life .
i'm taking you to the doctor when we get home , and i don't want to hear any arguments .
fine , dude . as if it's impossible to get some nail polish , apply it to someone else's toe - -
it's bluebells !
spit it out .
okay--i don't know about this .
as in the ... ?
one of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp . he said he saw a crop duster flying around the place .
come on , didn't all that steak make you thirsty ?
i'll take you ... why not ?
look - - can great white sharks communicate ? send out signals , or something ? you know , take revenge , sense an enemy ...
chewie , head for the bottom of the city .
maybe it's time i moved to a hotel .
totally !
i know . you're too strong , beth .
you ever see queen elizabeth sleep ?
intagliata was out chasing breakfast . they found his tracks . well , shit .
they don't have to be in the office christmas show ?
there is no fuckin ' way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin ' sorority .
come on ! it's not that hard . all you need is one person . once the right person thinks you're cool , you're in . everyone else will be too scared to question it .
no , they're not from wendy .
... fuck you mean , it's raining frogs ?
tell me .
where does he go ?
you folks need any help ?
i don't have to go through with it either .
damn .
what do you mean , you'd rather die alone ?
i think we've all seen " bonanza " .
well , you know now , so please tell me who you are .
many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body . where has it been laid out ?
knows ? he watches every " guest " on tape . this whole place is here for his sick amusement . and no so are we .
yeah , i was thinking ... i mean , i'm a celebrity now , do i really want to get married ? but on the other hand , if you're married , they can't testify against you .
tradition . royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries . dates back to the crusades and king richard . what i was born to do .
come - - it's a chance to try out your bedside manner , fettes . take a look at the child .
it's been quite a night . i understand that your understudy - miss harrington - has given her notice .
... i'm grateful to you , chauncey ... i would have opened to you with a touch , and you know that ...  ... but you're so strong - i can trust myself with you . i'm glad , chauncey - i'm glad that you showed so much restraint ...
michael invited me in . never invite a vampire into your house . it renders you powerless .
you want to dance ?
he means they're thieving dogs .
did he say that ?
you haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . . you didn't even call me . how could you not call back ?
big evil ?
how about you ? will you be alright ?
of course you can't ! i'm ... i'm shocked at you , buddy , real shocked ! now you be quiet or i'm going back to my own bed !
if you're looking at me , look elsewhere .
dr . winkel .
a case like this could hang around for months and i'm up for this player relations job with the " clips . " this gets out , false or not , no one'll touch me .
how i look out there , mick ?
no sir ! but you have to be ready .
i said stop it .
i said you win .
everything you couldn't .
because it's wreckable . i took another look and i changed my mind .
i saw him ! ! i saw kenny ! !
this is a delicate matter .
listen , captain cold , the suit , maybe , even though silver went out in the 70 ' s . but those boots are unforgivable . what is it with men ?
really , sara , i ...
why ? jesus ! why me ? why can't i wash the ashes from my forehead , year after year after year ? and why am i still drunk on your blood , the taste of your flesh on my tongue ? worst of all , why can't i feel the nails in my palms , the spear in my side , the crown of thorns round my head ? why do i have to know , over and over , that it was you . you who died ; died for my sins ! and that i will die for nothing . why ?
what was that ?
you'd take no offense if we called you dela for short ?
i prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place .
you don't need to be helped any longer . you've always had the power to go back to kansas .
... and let me guess . this robber - - he gets your money .
dr . weir , you have no experience with salvage procedures .
maybe i wanted to give my husband a fright .
a book of successful verse might have changed that , eh ?
can't survive on our bodies alone , nick . hurry up !
maybe you did it yourself .
skin cancer .
you're a goddess !
that's not consistent ... you said they never changed their style , they're robots ...
not with enough certainty to outweigh british interests in this fort .
why the fuck not ?
he was a nice horse .
uh - right . sure . the mets are gonna win tomorrow .
you want to hear this idea ? it's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand . go on , tell her .
i'm not heartless , ma'am . i have every sympathy for you and for the little girl , but if i were to consent to every operation brought to me , i'd have no time for teaching - - and that's a great responsibility upon me , ma'am - - a great responsibility .
would the network really not run it without the interview ?
think about it .
probably . i told him koessler had ordered the report , kept it secret .
another kiss ?
i find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another . i understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship .
i understand they've got the indians pretty well in hand ...
norman ?
i don't know , nobody does . i'm an employee .
charley , my husband , and i are ... divorced and kim , that's our daughter is about billy's age and the children play together a lot . so , i guess we see each three or four times a week .
- - to be put in that kind of position ...
he isn't any friend of father .
no , sir . i mean i didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought .
c'mon . talk to me . tell me what you're thinking .

the oak where jocelyn sprained her ankle .
i don't need one .

luthor , i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now .
of course she will . her public will demand it .
you okay ?
okay , everett .
where there's life there's hope .
don't even try it . you offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble .
but if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals .
well do i drop you off at the discount mart or the dairy queen ?
i'd like to tell you what we're doing so far . these are some of the steps i've taken as chief of police ...

whose " catcher in the rye " is this ?

ramn - - listen my kids ...
wonder what he said .
yeah i like him . don't you like him ? hey what's going on ? what is this ?
you're wrong , mr . stone . there are people who live and die without e'er seeing it . they can't see the country for the money in their pockets - - and some think their state's the country , or the way they live is the country , and they're willing to split the country because of that . well , i hope you'll meet all those , when you're grown . you'll meet the fire-eaters and the circassian beauties - - that's part of the fair , to be sure . but if we'd had to depend on them , in a permanent way , the country would have stopped at the allegheny mountains .
what ?
i'll go you one better ! maybe oswald didn't even pull the trigger , bill . the nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on november 22nd . and on top of that , they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day .
boy , this town . word gets around , doesn't it ?
well , come on , that's half a dozen armed men ...

it's not a joke . i've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now - - look , just come up and see him , okay ? five minutes , that's all i ask .
they got your message , kathryn . they played it for me . it was a bad recording ... distorted . i didn't recognize your voice .
in my home ! in the same room where my wife was sleeping ; where my children come in their pajamas , and play with their toys .

i don't care . i need my hat . i won't go without it .
you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just ' cause some watery tart threw a sword at you !
you break your leg , i'll have to shoot you .

a little early for a delivery .
where you guys at ?
i don't know .
don't worry . i can handle it .
in case things get too intense . it automatically freezes the game , gives you a breather . things can get pretty wild ...
but it's a responsibility being a berserk .
well , after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to .
don't say that .
you're still my best girl , cora .
bastards took off , though , didn't they ?
you'll see nothing of the kind , sheriff .

good morning , sir .

neither can i . not any of it . there's no reference point for what's going on ; it's never happened before . it's a clean break in the fabric of the universe ; a gap . there is nothing to do but experience it , moment-to - moment , and not let it destroy us .
oh ... well , maybe we better synchronize our spells ... or stagger them .
i am a foolish little thing . i am pink in my face , no ? it is only that i have been so lonely lately and ... i am ashamed . i'll see you tomorrow , okay ? unless ... am i fired now ?
i said that's the point !

sam ! ! !
i've been re-reading arsonist's daughter . it's so beautiful , grady . so natural . it's like all your sentences always existed , just waiting around in style heaven , or wherever , for you to fetch them down .
i know you , huh ? the car pools , he measles , the pta . it's not gonna be enough for you in the long run . you have to think long term .
i said new , this is an ' 90 .
you gotta be kidding ! this is unfuckingbelievable ! i have to start the evening crawling down capital records , i shoulda chose suicide then , but oh no , the night was young ! next up , my guitar ! the second most important thing i own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on hollywood boulevard ! then , then , after i burned up your brother , jazz ... i should say as a fucking footnote i've usually treated women like shit - - used corsages , the wet spot , you know giving out domino's pizza's phone number and saying it's mine ... tonight was different . i felt respect . i felt love . then jazz left me ... and <u> now </u> i get to die !
everyone split up - - we'll cover more ground that way .

i didn't see that much of it - - same as now . i only saw it as part of my own life .

what brings you into my saloon ?
sounds like terrorist heaven .
you go down there .
sorry .
gone . not a trace .
how ya doin ' ?
no , sir .

we should leave the past alone .
look . there's the order : you wrote it : desalvo , bianchi & buono , berkowitz and dahmer . it's going to be dahmer next . which means he'll kill a man .
just bring your card . half an hour .
my son's name is johnny ?
the order of seating at the upper servant's table is arranged personally by the queen herself .

do you care to tell me what mrs . white-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house ?
i found it outside .

is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy ?
his personal safe , he gave it a name . now you're telling me they've taken his office , put the buffet there ? then who knows what else they changed .
but see that's just the point . it can't stop at once . because it's in you . and you can't stop something that's in you .
what about cortina ?
and how would you describe him ?
he's a big flounder . could weigh two , three hundred . you got to lift him in with a winch .

when you finish , what then ?
quite right , mr . chekov . what is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity . before the captain and doctor mccoy freeze to death .
just for the criminals .
oh , you're good . what were you gonna do ? laugh the last three to death , funny man ?
the hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable ...
the problem is i can't hear myself sing with all this ...  ... music . you know what i'm saying ?
nonsense ! just bad press . all the deaths that occurred inside - - my own father's included - - all perfectly normal fatal accidents .
jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family .

jesus christ , ann . why is anybody anything ? i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad , and you don't allow for any gray areas , and that's what most of us consist of .
no .
fine . i'll go straight .
you tried to once . it was pretty pitiful .
not since we were kids .
well , son , i wish i could've shown you more , but this is all that's left . just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago . nineteen twenty-five , to be exact ...

comes running out the front door - down the walk to them . michael seems to pull inside himself . cool . aloof .
the only one you missed - - is the president .
i know it sounds crazy , sir , but we tried , and nobody answers any of the telephones .
perhaps the fall ...
he had it hidden in the dresser ! well , at least it was in there . he took it out , went to the phone and called somebody long distance . - - his wife's jewelry was in the handbag . and something about it worried him . he was asking somebody advice over the phone .
i'm handing out a free lei to every customer ! what do you think ?
a hot shower ... i haven't changed clothes in two days .

they don't look happy ... something's gone wrong .
my own .
it's miles . listen , i don't know if you even care , but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did . i think you're great , maya - - always have . from the first time you waited on me . and while i'm at it , i guess you should know that my book is not getting published . i thought this one had a chance , but i was wrong . again . don't bother reading it - - you've got better things to do . so you see i'm not much of a writer . i'm not anything really . the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand . we're leaving in the morning , and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you . i'm sorry . i'm really sorry .
pack of cigarettes . cute cat . what's its name ?

so you must remember sheriff wade .
to be able to do that is such a wonderful thing .
did you ever touch her ?
you . you're the same . no matter where you go , there you are . always the same old you . let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself . i know it sounds wild , but it's the latest thing in travel . we call it an " ego trip " .
huh ... i have no ... ... hard evidence ...
teh ... tehronne ?

whoa . what ?
and they want to blame us ?
what are you going to do ?
excuse me , but - i must formally protest this meeting . given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - i see no reason to involve the air force , the army , or mi - 6 . this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majesty's royal navy .
and who with better right ? when the first wrong was done to the first indian , i was there . when the first slaver put out for the congo , i stood on the deck . am i not spoken of , still , in every church in new england ? ' tis true , the north claims me for a southerner , and the south for a northerner , but i am neither . to tell the truth , mr . webster , though i don't like to boast of it , my name is older in the country than yours .
but you don't keep a cat , do you ?
groovy !
to me , it shows part of our history in this country , a time when we were considered inferior , sub-human .
not unless you can fly .

stand back .
i've seen ' em . i've seen ' em .

i turned him down flat .
ya never tell a guy about a broad .

you know as much as i do , miss schmidt - you were intimate with lime , weren't you ?
no . things are too hot . later . i'll send for you .
i tell you , it was so wonderful . i felt like a little boy . i saw paradise , jezzie .
just tell me the truth . i'm not the police . i don't care what you've done . i'm not going to hurt you , but one way or another i'm going to know .
aye , sir !

that's just what i tried to tell him . well , one word led to another . he really was a very charming fellow . so we talked for about ten minutes .
no , this is not possible . and i thank you for coming down here , though i suspect it's been a pointless journey .
do you always listen to what your mother says ? selina . something you choose your life . sometimes your life chooses you . save the day ..
don't you ?
the failures they remember . it's the successes they forget .
he took him over . his body . his - - his brain , everything what he knew . he's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things , and rhino--things . he liked being human . didn't want to change .
put me on the hailing frequency .

- - he's not my husband !
no , but , wade , see , i was bringin ' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in . it's my deal here , see ?
brian - - - - see ya tonight .
back-to-back sessions with the shrink .

do you really mean that ?
stop that ! we're not going any place . you love it here . tell me what the hell happened !
well - - this would be goodnight .
when ?
so i'm to be a dragon-slayer , is that it ?
sure .
you made it possible for us to get away at a few hours ' notice--you never asked why , but i guess you know .
yeah . i'll do that . as long as you're not patronizing me .
in the village . look what i found .

all right . as what ?
advance team , two men , stick to that goddamn cab , stay in radio contact , the rest of us follow in the van . nobody moves until the entire team's in place ...
it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air . in fact , i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque , too controversial .
sorry .
i don't want to cause any trouble .
andy ...
you dont say .
i think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older .

with my little sparrow leading team .
let me take you back inside , okay ?
oh , well , you know . i just clip a buck here and a buck there . not enough to notice .
we'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards . we'll make a mystery out of him . did you speak to mr . norton ?
what theory ?
sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens , flynne .
and you are ... ?
no ...
now margo , don't overreact . cuthbert has to cut costs somehow . my leaving makes perfect sense . this isn't exactly early retirement . i've overstayed the party a bit .
i feel sorry for him .
i must ... consult with my father .
this has everything to do with me dewey . i was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway . i'll be damned if i'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again .
why ?
uh huh ...
you tell us about america .
can it kill me ?
so how come you're putting lipstick on ?
the most powerful man in america is president nixon , probably you've heard his name .
jim ! what are you doing here ? jim lingk , d . ray morton ...
... it's really a fine opportunity for me . but i'm not sure i want to be a department head . it's mostly executive and administrative work . well , anyway , i told you about my father , and he depends on me a great deal , and ...
you help me find her , you got your rockin ' chair ...
shut-up !
check this out . hurry !
and - - what path is that ?
oh .. not that you ever get drunk ! no , indeed ! but a kind of overpowering lassitude or , more plainly , a deep and enveloping sleep .
do you have this agreement with you ?
tucker , i appreciate you doing all this , but i'm really strapped for time here and - -
oh no , you were too busy trying to keep some croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend . she showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel .
liar . she hates surprises . what are you ordering ?
where's that ?
this is noble , sir . his wife is crippled . his children are on the brink of starvation .
he's inside the house ?
what have you done ?
i can sea its breath in the cold .
yeah . and then it hits that little thing . that little punch bag . what is it ? the tonsils . the esophagus , whatever .
talking about ' like , ' you don't like me very much , do you ?
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps .
breasts .
did you discover anything in that tunnel , dr . jones ?
i know , i know . dwayne's dead , but we can deal with it . we'll pin it on him . the dea was driving jesse's car . no car phone . no radio . they couldn't have called me in .
my boyfriend thinks so , my girlfriend doesn't . if we could all live together ... but ... they hate each other . it's hard to be miss perversity when you're the only one at the party . d'you know what i mean ?
ricky ? ricky ' i lost the truck ' ricky ?
all i need , some twink from the fed poking around right now . check again with the paper , they had it forwarded . see if the neighbors know where they went , check all relations - -
what're you , nuts ?
oh huh
i thought you knew , boy ... they sentenced me by the mile .
nurse !

gottingen . that's in sweden .
well ... can't i play the romantic part ? i'm tired of always being the bad guy . you know , back in hungary , i played romeo ! i would like to be the lover again - - me , in a boat , with the girl ...

i think three ...
oh , it wasn't my secret , richard . victor wanted it that way . not even our closest friends knew about our marriage . that was his way of protecting me . i knew so much about his work , and if the gestapo found out i was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me .

be quiet ! fenner's the best pilot in china . he knows what he's doing .
you did create me in your image , nathan . before you i was a simple , happy , complete being , in harmony with the world around me . after you i became duplicitous , cynical , angry , anal , totally out of touch with my surroundings . in a word , nathan , i became you . lila has reintroduced me to myself . and , incidentally , what i'm about to do , kill you , is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the earth . before when i killed , it was for food or in self-defense . now i will kill for revenge . revenge is an abstract concept , nathan . and i learned abstract thinking from you .

she's cool .

if they had any reason to . why make it tough for themselves ? why go to all that trouble ? here's an open book . close it . no reason to keep it open . she was a nice girl , anyway . and perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose . perhaps she didn't kill the other one . you never know . give her the benefit of the doubt . leave her stay where she is . close the book . finis .
think he still thinks about her . but not like then . then was an obsession .
amazing .

she's probably ten years older than you .
so , you wanna play huh ? you little - -
we've spent a lot of time discussing those years . remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared , to the thought of the thing . thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite .

which is none of your business ... or mine .
ok , ok , so what's the point you're trying to make ?

excuse me .
jeffrey told her last night .
forget the bumbling americans , they will be like all the others . without the map to guide them , how can they possibly find hamunaptra ?

no .
i'll go on a hunger strike . i know your caper . the kidney punch and the rabbit-clout . the third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap .

never mind how i found you .
thanks , dad .
not really . i hear that expression , that one eats " like a bird , " is really a falsie , i mean a falsity , because birds eat a tremendous lot . oh , i don't know anything about birds . my hobby is stuffing things ... taxidermy . and i guess i'd just rather stuff birds because ... well , i hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed , foxes and chimps and all ... some people even stuff dogs and cats ... but i can't ... i think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather ... passive , to begin with ... most of them ...
did you ?
he's this way .
i don't know . i had a dream . in fact . the night i met you .  . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins . you know , birds . robins stood for love . and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love . and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference . i guess . until the robins come there is trouble .
... what the fuck , what the fuck ...

those of us who call ourselves patriots are not seeking to give birth to an american nation , but to protect one that already exists . it was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at jamestown , virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested . we are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away .

- - whatever , and the israelis and the palestinians don't . art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute , and the israelis and the palestinians are . art garfunkel and marvin gaye - -
junior !
right .
i guess .
jesus .
damn , fred , you can't give away all those .
welcome , welcome , one and all .
excellent picture .
well you know what i mean .
i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to - -
i don't care about luck , you understand me ? it ain't that .
what do you mean by that ?
they'll get in ! we'll all die !
i certainly sympathize with your problem , treves ... why don't you try the british home , or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him .
walter , for christ's sake ! he's crippled ! put him down !
chancellor .
i ' 11 be sure to mention that to him .
phillippe ... there is something i hope you understand . terrible cruelty has been used against you . and ... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it .
well , the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority - - and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim .
and if i don't ?
find your bowler ?
why don't you leave this town - go home ?
no .
louis gara's dead . l . a . p . d . found him dead in a car on ninth . and we've lost ordell .
probably . in my case it's probably a whole building .
had it with deals .
you call them ...
mom , this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway . the guy you yelled at for no good reason ...
not today . where are your friends ?
shu kai kim .
your name's freddy something .
what do i do ?
what are you now ?
by god , i'll fight the lot of you
that's right .
it's still just death , the absence of life--no honor at all . it's worse than the blue soup by far - - that nothingness . to you , though , it's the honor that crowns them all .
all right . you got it . you win . i'll deliver it now . just give me a moment to set it up .
are we going to sleep now ?
big ones , little ones , teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise .
i need some information from you then . how old are you ?
but so is vond-el
so long , sefton .
i said what time is it ? how long was i out ?
a company , wehrmacht , no artillery , we took twenty-three prisoners , turned them over to intelligence .
you ever do any hunting , peter ?
i am afraid .
you don't ever get scairt , do you , ma ?
but it's new , it's entirely new . it's so new , people will go mad for it . for example , i have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet , just a man and wife quarreling . suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation . duet turns into trio . then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in . trio turns into quartet . then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet , and so on . on and on , sextet , septet , octet ! how long do you think i can sustain that ?
this is my partner . we keep records of hospital visits . nothing personal .
right . i recognized you when i came in . i thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag . what do you think of that , miss daniels ?
i love you too . good night , darling -
never mind all that . what did you find out ?
like an underground club ?
what're you afraid's going to happen ?
it must have been safe .
a tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and - -
i take pride in my work .
you was a ... a crazy sonofabitch .
no , it will turn out well .
zip .
i don't know what you're talking about . who told you that ?
i said i'd listen to you , not necessarily believe you . you're telling me my people are in a plot against me . you're telling me my husband wants me killed . what do you expect ?
yes i do .
that was just loose talk . i don't want anybody dead .
how is it any different ?
jeez , ray , fourth and forty , throw the bomb .
no , it was a good thing . i mean , good in that it was very quick .
really ? my day ? well , i had a sweet little mongrel puppie named puff when i was a girl . this one reminds me of my dog , all shaggy ! so cute ! i loved my doggie very much , monsieur .
about the girl .
and you never told nobody about it ?
then i'll leave thee .
david , don't lose control .
no . well , not exactly ... it's that ... i felt like i wasn't in control . for the first time since ... all that . i'm scared .
where's bruce ?
perhaps .
i do .
and , cut ...
sort of like a letter of intent .
save that for the tribune .
a blow dart . seed pods . a plant press . pretty unimpressive stuff .
is that it ?
he personally asked you to ?
are they really ?
i want to tell you what somebody should do .
uh is a good start .
oh ... okay .
as it happens , i was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems ?
you don't know anything about joe - -
well what does he want ?
no .
doll , you and waski run on , too .
hey , you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging bible !
... they met when my mother was an opera singer ... in luxemburg ...
no , you're not .
not mouse , never mouse ! if anything - rat !
next thing , you're gonna be complaining about the seats .
why should i ?
what ?
i was just in the cafeteria , there's plenty of food in there . take a look for yourself .
that's good . i knew it wasn't nothin ' .
suppose you listen just for a minute -
i just got goosebumps .
you ... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much .
its because im shy , betty . so , when are you going to leave that old corpse mr . peterson and run away with me ?
all right .
i am programmed to detonate in nine minutes . detonation will occur at the programmed time .
kill him ... kill him .
let's talk about conklin .
and the pennies ?
my god , what have you done to him !
so why's he do it ?
ask security . you tell him , price . you've got me shadowed every minute of the day . or haven't you found out yet ?
don't worry , i've got lots of friends .
of course , you can see that lady over there , she is recording everything .
is that from one of the gospels ?
you said a woman couldn't have done it .
positive .
listen , palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten , isn't it ? [ 11 ]
is that you . d ?
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know ?
what are you saying ? that jon is radioactive ?
aha ! always got time to argue money , huh ... ?
yeah . a billion . right ... how are you ?
are <u> you </u> insinuating anything , m'sieu giron ?
a shame . you looked great tonight .
... with a woman's touch .
mcgill . no , the marriage'll take place as planned .
defense droids . i'm on it .
you jackass ! c'mon , let's get out of here .
don't you think he trusts us together ?
and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way ?
and i have no idea why .
you got it , man . it's stupid but it's true . true freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want . that's when you know you're living , man .
sure i know maya .
the order comes from starfleet command , dr . marcus , direct from the general staff .
honey , all the great ones came through here at one time or another .
a stellar idea , skull .
got her mother's looks .
hey take it easy man . they're scared .
" cora . " she's - still a girl of twenty ?
aww , you ain't that bad . you just need a little flava . first thing we gotta do is get you some new gear .
rogers hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars !
jack ... i feel like such an idiot . it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you .
just say it , dad .
you ?
your trial , jeanne . on a charge of heresy .
i appreciate your time -
and i'm here tonight and i won't let him get to you .
why ?
bye .
we can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this .
i just think ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids .
it certainly is .
like what ?
and don't pass on the right .
no , i didn't .
you sound so sure .
yeah , and he said it's a good way to break out a record . especially for what he said , and i quote , " would be a highly anticipated event , locally . " he helped me put out a press release .
dr . jones , we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors . i seem to remember that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist .
open it , captain !
think , reggie , you've got to think - - it may be what we're looking for .
eh , i don't know if you realise it , but ...
you're just come in - -
hi , sean .
maybe .
they look pretty smart , i think .
recognize him ?
are those the only two possibilities ? you wanna french fry ?
no .
no , i just thought - -
what do you mean ?
what do you mean ?
why should i call the police , huh ? they don't so any good .
you got no idea what they were after ?
nobody thought we'd do this . nobody really thinks it's going to work , do they ?
just , realize ... this is not some common lunatic . the type of intestinal fortitude it must take ... to keep a man bound for a full year . to connect tubes to his genitals . to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints . he's methodical and exacting , and worst of all , he's patient .
do exactly what i say .
bud ?
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy ...
pretty flowery for dave ferrie .
let ' em come . i'm ready .
carlos , can i ask you something ?
everything all right .

y-y-you fucking shot him ! that's what happened !
sixty five ... jeez louise !

i bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go ? movie stars ?
i'm amazed .
yah , not too bad . so it's nice up there ?
bobby's out .. what's the hurry ?
truman ? it's me , marlon . i need to talk to you .
not if you want me to keep makin ' ' em for ya .
i think i'm going to stay up for a while .
what's going on ?
no . let's at least finish the set .
all except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of . but it hasn't yet been tested .
exactly !
i can't .
it's mrs ... it's claire ... spencer . from next door . is everything - -

it won't . i trust him .

please , call me mordechai .
good for you . congratulations .
guess i did .
why ?
and a lot more . can we talk ?
long enough .
i don't know , brian ... i don't know ...

kendall junior is still in surgery , so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour - - the cadet we're talking to first is dunbar .

thank you , mr . dobisch .
i'll be with you always , my friends . who knows , maybe if i'm lucky , i'll rejoin you with wings and a beak .
what ?
yes , dr scott . a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter .
no what ?
i'll be back before you leave .
well , what is your definition of following ?
well , she's back to earth now . they're all pretty huffed up about your leaving . i think you better go back , kid .
next time i'll use valet parking .
did the emperor or empress give you any ... instructions of any kind ... before you left ?

i think he's going to the john .
reach for the limit i always say .
you trying to get a rise out of me , agent kujan ?

how do they know that ? how can they know any of that ?
just thinking about something .
but before i say goodbye i want to ask you one question : have you ever been in venice ?
fine . she's fine ... merle , what the hell are you doing ?
what a tragedy ... what a waste of a life ...
now , let's take the truck back and get something to eat .
you know when the first con was ever played ? it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden .
was rose .
what sector's the air conditioning ?
be kind to your sitter .
why are you so upset ? is there anything missing ?
that was a dance we invented at the international sand club .
debra , you're fuckin ' insane .
why do you think i called ?
what do i do meanwhile ? - - wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me ?
gee , let me think . " do you want to ... " is that the best you can do ? some tired hand me down rehash ? hey , pal , no one's gonna write a book about you . no movie rights . nothing . i've been through this before and much better i might add .
that's not the question . it's over . do you think that it's my fault ? if i'd ... if i'd ... i never should have taken it . there was no way that i was going to win .
sure . what other reason would there be ?
virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army . there's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal . they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests .
wherever you'd like ...
but i had heard his wounds were mortal .
yes ?
stacy , what are you waiting for ? you're fifteen . i did it when i was thirteen . it's no huge thing . it's just sex . if you don't , one of the other girls will .
thank you .
i'm asking you a question - -

traitor ! she'll marry you in hell !
but i saw you - - you looked in there , and you found out , miss boatwright .
two pianos isn't enough anymore , jack .
agent kulok , could you wipe my face ?
i could already feel the stuff working on me - - the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine - - maybe i should take a swim , i thought ...
it's the so-called " normal " guys who always let you down . sickos never scare me . at least they're commited .
no - - only occasional jobs .
this way ! come on !
good . ba will have to teach you to spin too .

i'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season .
larry ?
paul , it's not worthy of you . throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me . you can leave that in .
he scared the fuckin ' shit outta me . i thought he was dead fer sure .

how could you ?
turn around . hands on your head !
he said he'd consider it . it's between you and rodriguez .
i came for paul as well .
it was in his bureau .
not too good . that's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life , you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses . ed , i urge you to reconsider . i urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours . play fair with them , ed .
he said ' jack ' .
bye , house .
how the hell should i know ? i've never had a wife killed before . jesus christ ! <u> you </u> want this job , you don't know how to do this ? i guess i should have hired a professional .

yes , yes , yes , your thirty thousand dollars reward , which you would have to split with your team , which , <u> if </u> you get it , will not buy me a new <u> watch </u> ...
faithfulness he talked of , madam . your enduring faithfulness . now , tell me truly . when you found out he was gone , did you get engaged to your prince that same hour , or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ?

i'm going to run back to walter's arms , if he's still have me .
everything's fine . i'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down .
no , ma'am . no way . there's girls on the rubber rose who are political , but i don't share their views . i got no cowgirl ideology to expound . " politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it . "
tick-tock ...

i treated you like a son or nephew .
yeah . honey ?
jake , you made me promise not to get you excited .
... aye sir ... ?
oh , like jekyll and hyde ! ah , i've always wanted to play jekyll and hyde ! i'm looking forward to this production .

weddings are one floor down . congratulations .
western europe .
okay , then !
nobody will swim here until next summer . by then , the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges .
well , what are you talking about ? i just told you i was gonna get a
starling , we know who he is ! and where he is . we're on our way now .

the borg ship has modified its shields , captain . our phasers will no longer be effective .
oh , come on .
ok , i'm logged on to the municipal network . i'm showing sixteen people with the name sarah williams in l . a . county . none of them live in hollywood . do you remember the address ?
everybody's got a job to do . figure it this way : at least you get to go home alive .
what ? !
i'm not afraid of his words .
oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips .
sqweeep . we innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin - - " aliens from reticula 3 have hijacked patrick peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop ... "
you sabotaged the bus ! you kept us here ... to die ! first keith , then carl - -
dave , i'm just saying this as your friend . what you're doing is really , really wrong , and you've got to stop .
does what's going on bother you at all ? or are you just wearing your game face ?
i don't know ...
it will be all right . i'll take care of you .
stop pushing !
i'm serious .
go to the water , it's that way !
we got two paddles .
you be careful of that little bastard . he's dying to get in your pants , you know .
five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger . your standards have shifted a great deal , and i'd like to know why you've changed your mind .
right .
i want you to get legal onto corporate confidentiality agreements . boundaries of their constraint . kentucky state law about . i want you to drop everything .
personally , i've enjoyed your community very much . but my friends do not care for this mystery . they are determined to leave as soon as
who ?
how did you find out ?
yeah , cap . back in narcotics .
hey , pete . can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill .
if that were true , i would not be here .
well joe ain't gettin ' here . we're on our own . now , i don't know a goddamn body who can help him , so if you know somebody , call ' em .
we don't know . and that's the point . maybe there's a mole . whatever , it's a disaster . and it's a joint interagency task force . i have dea , atf , u . s . customs components in on it . so the penetration could be from any one agency . what we do know is i have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions ' cause i have to assume our operational security is blown .
sometimes i think i do .
that's better . how do you want us ?
and fifty bucks a lead .
he is dying . he knows it .
they gave me two weeks . i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew , who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost , but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor , making this even more difficult to achieve ...
no , m'sieu !
i just follow my footsteps , one at a time , trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones .
you may step down .
not like mr . dorfmann .
... alright .
whoever you are , don't call again .
uh-huh .
look , asshole , i don't got time for this . if you got a problem , you better take care of it yourself .
i'm afraid i have to insist you leave .
what's the matter ?
28 continued :
what does charlie mean ?
mademoiselle .
mr . crabbin .
you little liar ! get out of here !
won't he be looking for you about now ?
can i tell you a story , rick ?
you had to deal with him in running the club .

when i grow up , i'm going to go to mhravitch .
i think so .
i know .
it's all arranged for tonight . eddie mack's gonna be there . and offisa korruptsky , too .
then , why don't you just die . i'm going . they'll find your body years later , the old recluse lady , she ate cat food , ten years of the new york times , unread , piled on top of the unread mail , the tv still on . make up your mind . live or die . i'll get coffee .
they didn't fire her ?
it's all a goddamn fake . like lenin said , look for the person who will benefit . and you will , uh , you know , you'll , uh , you know what i'm trying to say - -
i'm not up for running into anybody . let's just kick it here , alright ?
what the hell you doin ' ?
you plotted the course of cyclops ? then that's <u> our </u> course ! wherever <u> he </u> goes , <u> we </u> go ... until we get him !
how you doing this morning ? sleep ok ? i didn't .
well , i didn't want to say anything , but i thought the dead man was my brother .
i saw her . she looked just like this - -
i didn't want to leave it there ...
get back here , rool !
oh god , we can't get out !
charles . okay . miller ?
harry -
uh huh ...
i'll take my chances .
you--a friend to me ?
see the pull of a book like twenty chefs , is not who i put in . it's who i leave out .

it would be better if he called us .
howls .
working whores with squad two .
i'll tell you what ... you tell me what and i'll do it for . i'm a bit of a whizz on this thing .
what do you want him to do ?

louise and darryl don't get along .
oh , i don't mean that . i'm sure i'm going to need your help .

maybe the plane gave it indigestion ...
no ! no cops ! that's final ! this is my deal here , wade ! jean is my wife here !
you'd better . i'm very angry .
no , i'm more furious . i'm pissed off . i feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels , and then he can't even do it ! he has his friend do it for him !
they wrong ?
no .
back up . go out the other way .
i can't even hear myself think .
... until he found tungsten .
okay . then you can be of use .
i mean , why do you do it ? what purpose does it serve ?
time to change numbers again ?
look , maybe i should just ...
we don't know that .
yeah , but i don't know - -
good . i'm getting you clear too . let's just keep the line open .
it's not what it looks like , vanessa . at ease , boys .
those " dears " sound like daggers . may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak ?
umm . three i believe . but i'm not sure .
let's keep it that way .
oh dear . have i made a blunder ?
i know . i stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real .
five minutes .
over at rko ?
is llewelyn there ?
i was jaywalking .
no reason to get nasty . yeah , i've stayed in the organization . but then again i never got the percentage you did .
took you long enough .
i don't think so .
by all means .
well if they can kill the president , they can certainly get me .
yes .
there's a kind of a lone shark , called , uh ...
what is going to happen ? where is harry ?
i gotta go , flip . thanks .
... so , we'll hit the library first and fan out from there . they've got all the l . a . phone books , plus medical directories ... we're not gonna let him hide from you any more , okay ? i'm making this my personal mission .
a fort ! unconsciously , you chose a name that was belligerent . where were you nurtured ?
how'd that happen ?
well done , james .
burbage has my keeping but you have my heart .
i don't know what's goin ' on with zavitz , but that was way , <u> way </u> outa line . you understand ?
c'mon let's ...
how ' bout manson ?
telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids .
and that's the point , that we all have stories . the hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king . it's the stuff of life why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater ? goddamnit , why should that be a hard pill to swallow ? don't call it new theater , charlie ; call it real theater . call it our theater .
you wanna commit suicide , fine ! you got some death - wish , fine ! but you will not drag this company down with you !
which one ?
happy new year .
two glasses of ice water with ice .
my court , i go first .
on what basis ?
how's it going ?
don't be absurd ; it's only a play .
miss kubelik , one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character - - and as far as i'm concerned , you're tops . i mean , decency-wise - - and otherwise-wise . cheers .
want to go for a little ride ?
i don't think that's a good idea , lenny .
three oclock .
it's nine o'clock .
well , if you could come sometime just before we close , then i could show you everything and then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points ...
why not ?
that's right .
do you want to see themis and manto butchered ? if i die fighting commodus he won't care about you . if i live i'll come and get you .
yes , i go now .
buddy'll take care of him . keep him out've trouble . he's jack's conscience . always has been . he tell you how they met ?
going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on .
where is it touching you ?
or shall i call my servant ?
it's a carlton fisk baseball card .
it'll never be finished .
what the - ? how did you - ?
yes , i ...
good-bye , peter .
down to the incinerator .
it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes . especially if you're over near the bay .
i love your smell .
swap them ? for what ?
but you said he went off a little , after the accident , when those mechanical arms - -
but suppose he loses ?
you're outta your depth here , miss darrow !
oh right . the mustache coffee cup . the one that was sitting on the dash .
i'm sorry . it is .
what's so special about him ?
shit !
you mean you're still in contact with her ?
<u> i'm </u> best at driving the cat .
war finds me willing . i know it won't bring back all i have lost . but it can bring what none of us have ever had - - a country of our own . for that we need a king . we need you .
jesus , caesar !
if there is a keyser soze he'll be looking for you .
yeah , if i can .
you have to put yourself out there a bit more .
and if they're asked , that's what they'll tell the , world .
there's a mate of swanney's . mikey forrester - - you know the guy . he's come into some gear . a lot of gear .
i ain't never met anyone come close to you , sugar .
but it could be anywhere .
not like this . are you even listening ?
great scott - scotty - dr everett scott .
the refridgerator .
he was trying to kill you , right !
you want to talk about it ?
if he passed me materials , i'd have them . i don't .
i opened the present you got me from harrison's .
i'm afraid so .
shit ...
no sir , i don't believe i do .
his moods at this time were complex and varied .
well - - at the moment , that'd be me .
it is ?
you'll have to keep them anyway . the man at the aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back .
this ain't about that and you know it . this is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew .
aspen doesn't want us mr . graham . they threw us out .
she thinks he's a pig .
eta with target ; four minutes .
you want to stick around here , sailor ? see if we can get some work ?
well , that's what i knew then . or who i knew , i should say . you see , i was trying to court miss angstrom . i went to the meeting to impress her .
' fraid so .
federal ?
you don't have a boyfriend or anything do you ?
being a superhero , wanting to save the world . it's so ... unselfish .
ain't heard from ralph since last christmas . don't matter - - i've got a new crop . i'm a strong tree with branches for many birds . i'm good for something in this old world and i know it , too ! we know that she will rout the devil .
you doing okay ?
granted , monsieur .
yet you look so sad . a great man like you should not be sad .
don't you remember ...
we came here from a solar system on the verge of self - annihilation ... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life . a small group of us set off to find a new home ... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds . that was three hundred and nine years ago .
did you call the police ?
wait a minute . rowan - what is going on ... ?
then we're stupid and we'll die .
aren't you off-duty ?
i know he does .
yeah , i mind . you bet your ass i mind .
but what about your theory ? the existence of someone like taylor might prove it .
my whales ? where could you take them where they'd be safe ?
of course they'll notice it . but look - - this is a good place for something .
you don't own this man !
yes .
shut up , cleo . di , how much do you need for an abortion ?
and maybe that's why i had the bad luck . maybe if you gave me away , and i got married in a church , in a wedding dress , instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door , maybe then i wouldn't had the bad luck i had .
you really enjoy yourself , don't you ?
no . it's not right .
she wants to know , sir , do you like your hair .
you believe this , don't you ? that you're a vampire ? you really think ...
i wouldn't go in on a deal with her . she blamed you for it .
absolutely .
is it true that you and love went on a blind date ? she hit you with a bottle ?
how can i serve you in this ?
front page ?
two hundred meters .
keep firing !
i have demanded it - - and common priests present themselves ! can you imagine the arrogance ? common jesuit priests try to act as my equals , and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order ! no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can , and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold . even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france ! he suspects the governor general of jesuits , whoever he is , is angling to become pope himself .
there's something buried there .
no . oh , richard , i'm sorry . i'm sorry , but , but you , you are our last hope . if you don't help us , victor laszlo will die in casablanca .
probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner .
... in texas ... didn't it ? that's what happened ... oh my god .
again .
maybe she got jealous of johnny boz , too .
i'm home from school . my father's in the hospital .
who would want to do such a thing as that ?
it's the last house on the left . she lives downstairs .
what are you sure about ?
father , i think you should rest .
i don't ski .
why not ?
keep going !
i wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together . and i wondered if i could wait that long .
barry , i'm fucking broke ! i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like , but it's gotta stop .
then what ?
i can just hear the editorial wee - wee-weeing when looseleaf and i start flying in pacqualinincheewa root . i can hear the alice-sit-by - the-fires now : " we discovered it in the amazon rain forest . now we cure you with it . now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks . "
i'm billy hayes ... at least i used to be .
clyde wynant's crazy ... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this . no wonder the police think he has something to do with it .
look are you just fiddling around with me or what ?
i know what a marker is .
deal ! i'm dealing with two guys named cheech !
jack , no . i just explained the whole thing to you . it was just between me and salvy , if it had anything to do with you and vickie , i woulda told you about it .
this isn't happening .
she knows it was our fault !
kinship .
oh kevin - - don't stop !
i'll have whatever violet's drinking .
you think it'll send this guy back to hell ?
because i can't ! okay ? she wouldn't understand !
sure . every bunco man in the country knows gondorff .
what if i told frank that you opened me ?
okay , okay ! listen-up . coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal . number one , gladys says a coupla yous are gettin ' sexy with your hips durin ' the " physical fitness " routine ...
you mean ...
well i don't want to seem desperate or anything .
why not ?
weird . like after all those years you would remem - -
the planet vulcan . in hailing distance , sir .
it was staged ?
get the hell out !
you told bonita , but you didn't tell him , right ?
yeah , yeah , like a son . i've known this boy since he was sixteen . the first time i saw him , back in oakland , i said , " this is a talented boy . this is a smart boy . "
i just don't want margo to miss her train . as it is , she'll barely make the theater ...
yes . cathy lee crosby stayed here .
did you know you were parked in the handicap space ?
you see , that's worse .
right there , bobbie .
' booby traps and improvised antipersonnel devices ' !
i'm busy .
no , that's your fault . it's her fault for not watching over my precious son , as if it were her priority . which means , the most important job .
that why you moved from the last town ? ' cause you were in trouble ? you can talk about it if you want to--i know about it anyway . routine check .
only in the movies .
of course ! you want out ?
actually , i'm free sunday .
it sounds nice .
sure .
i know where to find him ... he lies out on the marsh , raven-fodder ; his horn torn from his head .
how do you know that name ?
it couldn't be .
well , like mama told me , aunt rootie , dell's mama ? she found cockroaches in dell's underwear .
you're farmer ? oh ... well , look , they took your stuff out . moved it to some hotel , i think .
soran may still be obsessed with getting back . and if he is , he'll do anything to find that doorway again .
do you own a video camera ?
do you really think it was brave ? didn't he bow to him and shake his hand ?
how long has -
now he'll be up all night ...
oh , stewardess . my husband is very sick . can you do something , please ?
i shall look forward to it .
what do you want ?
they already know it's you .
no , please ...
they know you are tutsi !
don't worry ' bout nothin ' , big bro . he in the best fuckin ' hands in rancho chocomunga , baby ! this my world , you just a nigga late paying rent . ain't that right , nephew ?
that didn't leave much for wallace reid .
then he called me a faggot .
cole and munoz ? i been on this case for two years .
he didn't . get over it .
yes .
so . i'm here , you're here , the piano's here . what d'ya say ?
yeah , because you're allergic to their saliva . i've made a lot of sacrifices for you , juno . and in a couple years you're going to move out - - and i'm getting weimaraners .
... what ?
jesus , rudy - -
how are your teeth getting along ?
exquisite , but i don't think ununderstanding is a word .
a mass for the dead .
for what ?
coupla more rings ... 24k .
you killed santa claus ?
i told ' em about it . they know i'm well . that mizz wheatley made me some biscuits .
why not ?
don't give me this oprah-book club bad upbringing shit , because you turned out fine .
so let's talk .
' but we're alone now , and i'm singing this song for you . '
go get tom an ' al . i dunno what to do . i got to feed the fambly . what'm i gonna do with these here ?
i thought you might .
he means the last that we know of .
whenever you see someone who's really messed up , especially amputees and retards . you give them money . but if it's just a regular bum , you pass them by .
oh yes , my sister's just ... she's ... wonderful .
neither .
so they've been destroyed ?
what ?
- - overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career , am walking around with a pocketful of cherry mike & ike's ?
i won't try to keep up with you . i'm not as fast on my feet as i once was .
dad !
you heard me . a bird in a gilded cage .
i'm not bad , i'm just drawn that way .
i'm taking off my mike .
that's your way , not mine .
tell me .
whoa .
that's the point ! walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before alice can cover it up .
okay .
who said it was my first time ?
mister laplante ... bernie ... i ... just for a few moments ... i want to be a human being , not a reporter . i'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and i looked up , and some man came out of the smoke , his face smeared with mud , and soot and ... and he ... saved my ... life . off the record . was it you ? why would you deny it if it was ? because you took my purse ? why ?
uh-uh . you're on your own .
congratulations .
doing what ?
what about jennifer desiderio ?
we found one .
i put in months of quality time with vicky . sherman meets a chick for one night and scores ? this is just wrong .
is there a reward in this ?
aw , c'mon , vick - -
you're a career intelligence officer , shermin . you'll be in the air with us .
i've never been in a place like this before .
outside of that .
no , it's got a little left . they'll be in to change it .
would you have believed me ?
rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise .
ohhh , nothing .
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere .
could be leon's .
i'm calling out . going to hit the hospital-see how caitlin is . then try to see veronica .
he really was !
then make your choice .
daddy , it's like i been tellin ' ya - -
with or without ' em . twelve--noon . the senate convenes at twelve o'clock .
i need a man who knows where i am .
well ... no , of course not - -
friend of yours ?
good shooting , danny !
well , i <u> am </u> living , aren't i ?
yes , sir !
oh , you need a shave . you mustn't go looking like that . there's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom . compliments of the house .
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug ?
very well . but , it will only sit gathering dust .
how long have you been with them ?
i'm sorry to keep you . how can i help ?
- - richard .
i don't . patrick doesn't . and his brother and sister don't . and they're in the house with him .
there are two important psychic conduits called the " pingala " and the " ida " . the pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril .
we ? you've taken it ?
a post office box .
i've been working night and day . i haven't had time .
jesus , sally . you are a medical miracle . the only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier .
it was once worn by louis the sixteenth . they call it le coeur de la mer , the - -
there's a big black spider in the bathroom .
he just left . kissed her on the cheek .
hey , elephant girl , call her or something ... just let her do my one meal here . i'll pay whatever . i'll wait . do it ! ! !
ann ! say , why didn't yuh
- - and confuse him - -
have fun storming the castle .
i mean , won't she talk ? she seemed kind of upset .
who is it ?
orange whip , nectar of the bowling gods . thanks sweetie . millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip . theo takes the other glass .
oh - - all right .
i think so .
what about the dog ?
i'm kidding , emmi . what about a record player ? you have that , too ?
well , what about us ?
i'm sorry . i guess i dialed the wrong number .
i heard . who the hell let them up there ?
what are you talking about ?
i'll be ready .
really ? was the third act too intense ?
charlie ...
it'll be like taking candy from a stranger .
good . he never doubted you .
maybe later .
sure . shall i - - i mean shall i just stand here ? i mean - - i don't know what you want me to do .
did you ever see anybody renew ?
koko , write down their names , don't just make marks .
* henry hill ? * that crackpot ? that long-haired - - ! why , you should have killed that so fast - - !
quiet ! quiet ! there are ways of telling whether she is a witch .
it's all right , ma ... i been watchin ' ... only i wish ...
that one i'm real familiar with .
you imagined it .
i didn't mean they were assholes . i mean if they're leaving , get ' em outta here .
don't go telling anyone . it'll ruin my reputation .
i don't understand . who's responsible for all this ? who is khan ?
stop this . this isn't funny .
" age of enlightenment " . shit . like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference . how demeaning . i may as well have just said " let me jump your ignorant bones . " ...
waldos .
sheesh ! i never worked for so little , except once , and that was a very noble cause . - - - 93 .
so like i was saying , things were going pretty well in my life .
you're the tom hardy i've been reading about in the papers , right ? new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres .
what do i do ?
you heard of harry lonsdale ? otherwise known as back-you-up with-a - hatchet harry , infamous for his removal of digits ?
was that supposed to make me feel better ?
huh ?
they respond to fear , right ?
but it costs money to have an abortion . even at the free clinic . you tell damone to pay for it . it's the least he can do . it's the guy's responsibility too .
i got sicker .
no . that's what i mean - i'm being fired for what i didn't do .
guess he talked to you .
whoa , cool your maples . over the bridge , past the peter pan , last house on the dead end . theo releases sid's hand . sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand .
i'm not in the mood .
no . we won't . i have climbed it a time or two before , and i know all the places to step . just follow me ... move easy ... don't look down ... and don't stop . if you stop , you'll crash through for sure .
how's your wife ?
guess i'm not used to so much .
don't think i'm weak , just because i'm a woman . i have power . give in , stop fighting me , ethan . i always get what i want .
oh yes , of course . there was someone with me . a lady .
well , i used to live there . i used to live there for years . you know , but it's gotten-it's so dirty now .
two or three days ! while lyssa is in their hands ?
lord walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the english art world . has a couple of doctorates no less .
my orders are from com-sec intel - - b . l . willard , 4th recon - -
i am . hur you ?
mind if i join you ?
sorry coach .
i am the cloudburst that quenches the flames .
can you love a player ?
as if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place .
well , in that case ...
... when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake .
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable ...
i must be goin ' deaf ' cause i thought ya said , ' ten cents . '
top dollar .
was it a boy or a girl ?
i know .
what about the other two ?
very clever .
sorry .
see what ?
i'm her father - - supposed to be , but i'm not able to . yes . yes , i am . it may be the only thing in my life i've been so clear about wanting . even if it takes a big fight .
why ?
what's he do ? nibble your bum ?
a herring ? isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars ?
oh goodness , no .
i don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it . get the castor oil .
i'm not sure i'd be good company tonight .
that bad huh ?
not if you stopped hurting people . write the truth gently .
talk to the bomb .
time to start talking .
in what way ?
what's the other ?
you'll get used to it . i'm more worried about your tactical mistakes .
i was just showing emotion .
i'm sorry about that , epps .
now me , i was born rich . i've never worn the same pair of socks twice .
deal !
for about two seconds .
that .
tell you what . you get me close to a big buck by ten , kid , there's another hundred bucks in it .
the name's charlie .
four months .
wallace's followers .
how did we get here ?
i knew what he wanted , and i didn't want any part of it .
for rape and murder .
christine ! mister van orton is a valued customer ...
when will my case be heard by the tribunal ?
or perchance ...
because my boyfriend , who i thought was in america , is in fact in the next room .
who's nina ?
what could be more restful than this ? ... excuse me , what is it that you want to try ?
i do not speak english .
where is everybody ?
listen to me - -
she's dead .
close !
mary said you might be coming .
and i've got a witness ! your mr . white saw the crime .
very well , mr . chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on ... but i must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon . if indeed , you do reside here , you will have to move out .
ok , ok , man , don't get heavy , i'll sign . just to get things moving , baby .
three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . see , i gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on .
your honor , i know as much about these gangs as anyone ; i'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked ... i assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime - -
you're a real excitable sort , aren't you ?
keep your voice down dude , my mom's around here somewhere . she doesn't know we're sexually active .
get dressed . we're leaving .
34,000 . but they're real short lines . ' just came out that way .
i'm not running a charity ward ...
it's not easy to be calm when -
ok forget it , just stay on the phone .
you don't work there anymore , bobby .
not unnecessary ones .
what happened ?
your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in huntsville .
and how did you get it ?
eli . why can't you remember their names ?
why , yes .
i will . but i must find the right moment .
we can't shoot in the old mill .
come on , admit it . k worried you , didn't he ? he always worried you . in 1942 , he's thirty-four years old , you're already fifty-six . and goebbels and goering keep saying to you , ' if you don't do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i don't care how great you are . it's the oldest story in the book , the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck . the real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you'd be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party's boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .
i don't know what happened ! i don't know who he is ! i don't know what he wants ! i don't even know who i am ! the only thing i know is that if i stay here , i'm never gonna find out !
it's not gonna hurt you .
good news comrades , it's better than we'd hoped . lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake .
he had something . he showed me how to bend the rules . a little levitation . a few fireworks .
but what's gotten into you ? ... we would have known . sandro must be out in the garden somewhere , taking a breath of fresh air , or watching the break of dawn . it would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type .
did you ever have a baby ?
it's like this , wayne . two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack . these two people can't see each other , yet they know they're there . now , they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom , or one of them can make the first move .
i feel mocked , insulted , with no sort of satisfaction in prospect . we don't have to fight with steel . i can fight with words . i'm not an inarticulate ape , you know , who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary . call him up in east st . louis , penelope . tell him to come here .
in the projects . like eddie murphy's " the pj's . "
maybe you should go , alex.you ' ll meet someone wonderful .
' thoughts ' ? not a one - - but i did hear a voice last night .
my dreams died long ago .
noooo . free snort . that's it .
did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings ?
no , honey . no , he's not here .
phone security systems , everything works . you ask for it , we got it !
that reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery ?
tonight , somewhere in the city , innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that ; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero captain god .
you're so sweet . oh , why are there not more men out there like you ?
you find out ?
i think i might have .
you could buy them .
with the pearls - -
when i left him , he was in his bed , safe and sound .
you okay , jerome ?
mm-hmm .
two more nights in this lunar cycle .
do you have a hard heart , marylin .
not anything , bill . don't test me .
knowing mankind as i do , that could take centuries !
i am not an american , mr . russ . my daughter is not an american .
but he's not quite the same guy anymore . don't get your hopes too high ?
of course , your line of work's only as good as the people you find .
i hate innocent bystanders . whine , whine , whine . will he settle ?
don't be silly - - he would not do anything . he is not yet old enough to be interested in girls . he says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age .
we'll ask evelyn . evelyn ? evelyn !
it's three .
yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah , it's , you know , it's a bed and hot water .
you want to tell me what the hell's going on ?
now , baby , that's got nothin ' to do with you . i just carry that . you been listenin ' to them cops too much .
her . it's an obvious move . i'm building a case against her , remember ?
that frank was working on . yeah . he thought franky needed some help , so they bribed a juror . so franky finds out . he comes to me in tears . he thinks that anybody who knows what a ' spinnaker ' is got to be a saint . i told him ' franky , wake up . these people are sharks . what do you think they got so rich from ? doing good ? ' he can't be comforted . he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they've disappointed him , he's going to the judge to rat them out .
you know , if you let me come over to your place once in a while , you could put on a clean shirt in the morning .
<u> pay </u> her .
we gotta go to rimgale , stephen .
umm , he's going to make it isn't he ?
yeah , well i guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing ... besides , ain't no such thing as an ex-cop .
mimi ? ... oh , dorothy's mother . does she have to be up to something ?
i said , no thanks .
i know . snorri ! get your oar out !
do you want to hear my list of english kings and queens ?
now get out of my sight , you hideous primate .
don't send flowers , joe . i'm not dead yet .
looks like a fake to me . loan denied !
i wanted you to say , " no ! i wrote the part for my girlfriend dolores . "
sure .
it's not funny , jim , i'm scared .
give it back nicholas !
will this proposition entail my dressing up as tina turner ?
i sure as hell hope so .
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority ? are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for wichita's lightning rod ?
ye have , have ye ?
if you don't start telling the truth ...
harry !
yeah , and if he gets me , i'm pretty sure you're next .
... fine .
twentyish . it isn't important .
just a manner of speaking .
no , he won't . i wired him that i wasn't coming .
no .
what'd he say ?
you don't love me .
guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin ' job . i had to let him help with the car .
you can keep them .
we just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you . gorgeous boat , hundred-and-seventy - five-foot pleasure cruiser . i think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job , as i said , a bit more competitive .
it was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact . suspect zero came to represent every killer dick low had not caught . the idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine . for someone like low , there would always be a suspect zero . we couldn't let richard go where that idea was taking him .
yeah , i hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place . watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous .
i could help you . i could get you off that .
did you get that , kulnick ?
in manhattan ?
i heard rumors you were back . about kip ...
she was unhappy .
what do you think ?
what the fuck is wrong with you brian ! ? if you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes ... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer . he is ... for real !
i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
why ? why ? she's dead . why are you calling an ambulance ?
yeah , you're the worm guy .
you tell lies , dad . you tell amusing lies . stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime . they're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty . and the thing is , i believed you . i believed your stories so much longer than i should have . and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible - - everything ! - - i felt like such a fool to have trusted you . you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined . just as charming and just as fake .
so jason doesn't sleep ... how does that help us ?
i mean , you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin ' door ? are ...
pro boner ? pro bono , huh ? for whose good , supposedly ?
wait till the mai-tais wear off .
but they're somebody's children .
what !
if the documents section can't do it ... i'll send it up to langley ...
your timing is excellent , mr . scott . you've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home . how much refit time till we can take her out again ?
prepare to receive the act of penance . how many sins have you committed since your last confession ?
jesus , bob .
doyle .
of course - -
mother used to sing the songs in german and her voice would echo across the valleys
what if their answer is , ' oh , that's easy . a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape , our population out of control , violent crime , no food ... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social . the weak . the sick . the unwanted . and ever since we've been doing great . '
krinkle , you're lookin ' at the two future cops of the month . we have it , and if i say we , i don't mean me and him , i'm referring to the whole department . haven't had a decent bust this whole month . well , we mighta come in like a lamb , but we're goin ' out like a lion -
remember slamming the cab door in my face and .. you know , it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a ...
all of what dewey ? you do know something , don't you ?
he would have loved this .
what's going on ?
you should see little montel play . little montel is the next maradona .
ah , charley and i are ... well , we're thinking about ... i mean , actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together .
well ... heck , this is the first time i ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman ! i'd figure roughly ...  ... your car plus five hundred .
gotta meet a guy and head out for silverado .
hello , hal .
so long , freddy . don't take any wooden nickles .
that's too bad , jeff . well , i guess i can't be lucky every day . forget i called .
what ?
my point exactly ! somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper ! fucking kennedys get away with everything . do you see me screwing everything that moves ? for christ's sake ! i did what the new york times editorial page said we should do ! i ended the war , i got salt i with the russians , i opened china ! so why are these cocksuckers turning on me ? because they don't like the way i look . where i went to school .
yeah ... you're married aren't you , jack ?
yes .
we just about got killed . you know what happened ? we just about got killed , and you want to go on ?
all i'm asking you to do is listen . " the heavens made a girl named chris , with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her glory untold . "
so are you !
alexander ... i know you .
it's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself , not just because i'm my brother's sister .
oh , sure .
he's dead . whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now .
this is an amazing present . what a sweetheart you are .
in the old books . it's called a glaive .
what are we going to do ?
i think i'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave . just might be his first broken heart .
you ain't shot .
hi , private eye guy !
that much , huh ?
yes , sir .
lieutenant .
i passed .
how long since he was bitten ?
that's not what i call conclusive evidence of an abduction .
right . got lost in the rocks .
i think buzz is retiring soon . in fact , i think he's retiring tonight . kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila .
i can see that . sure .
neff , you know better than this ...
shit , girl , you couldn't'a been eleven .
he was , he's just as crazy as ever . he was on his way to get a blood test .
yes , i ...
i want you to go back to new hampshire ... think things over .
then what brings you back ?
because your mother and i need the rest , sugar . now buzz .
do you ... remember me ?
then find another theater
remember me ?
page 32 . " deputy dewey filled the room with his dim-witted barney fifish presence . " i think you've explained yourself .
when does frederick ever come with her ?
let me call you a car , linda .
feller runs the chronicle . here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you .
yeah , that's why i called . i mean , maybe fed-ex would tell me where she moved - -
me ?
that's what i'm doing .
are you out of your mind ? !
when does he graduate high school ?
was it you ?
yes , there was a man with you ... she brought you here ... she didn't know what else to do .
don't worry . in a few seconds you won't feel a thing .
the key , wade .
fuck ! !
yeah , go on ...
i own a brownstone on this block .
he deserved it .
you weren't even there . you were back at the station . kalinsky told me ...
you're planing something , cathy .. but i won't let you - i'll warn them against you .
a month .
my name is rita .
no .
dick , if you're ready to do it now , i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs . torrance the kitchen , while i continue on with jack .
tired ... and i'm getting tired of being so tired . other than that , i'm doing very well .
god , you are so hot .
fork ah did ?
i didn't mean that .
would you care to go topside ?
why us ?
i don't know - -
so what happened to the barbecues , and fishing ?
it's nothing . it's just the helium , because of the air pressure .
sintag .
i just want a salad . you really think i'm a loser , don't you ?
lower .
if there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid , it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped .
please let me help you .
absolutely not .
look , i'm sorry to bother you but i was wondering if you could help me out .
am i crazy , or do you actually have something there ?
my golly , you know ? all my life i grew up in the city , but every summer ... would you like a cigar ?
that road can be a bad one at night , melanie .
and his book was a lot fatter than yours .
we don't get many presidential assassins .
they fill seven floors . we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world . just to give you an idea , there are more than three million insects specimens . not to mention amphibians , reptiles , birds , anthropological artifacts , meteorites , minerals and gems . only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display .
another one ?
listen , lady , we can do this downtown if you - -
creasy ... i'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances .
and he agreed ?
uh-huh . . .
doesn't want you thinking too much , huh ?
... wants a piece ...
through , through his book .
look ... i don't know . what am i supposed to be , his keeper or something ? yeah , he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head . right ?
please , papa , i have a secret path .
if you don't keep your neck in and your nose clean and you'll never have no trouble down here .
aganishish ? yeah , that sounds like john .
yes , you could . i think you need it more than i do . it'll help . i promise .
we don't get a gig .
are you done ?
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure . only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one . unkillable . but now i believe that is going to change .
yeah , she does .
i woke to the sound of zoe's breathing . it was laboured . i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen . i grabbed her , rushed to the kitchen , and splashed water on her face .
when i write my memoirs i think i'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one .
she doesn't have a rolodex .
somehow i don't think inviting maya to your wedding is the right move . in fact , after your bullshit , it's going to be hard for me to even go to the hitching post again .
yes .
what are you saying ?
can we look at one ?
what do you mean " choose ? " we don't understand .
yeah , but it weighs better than thirty tons . no way they could stop it .
no , were going to recover the disk , understand ? ! now move !
san francisco's changed . the things a that spell san francisco to me are disappearing fast .
i told him we might not need it , if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property .
no . i was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us . maybe see where you grew up - -
it's okay . it's okay , now . really .
no proof ?
who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music - shostakovich , prokofieve , and myaskovsky .
a friend of mine . i don't know his real name . he's dead now .
no .
listen to me - -
ah , my dear francis , what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last .
nice to meet you ?
um ... do you people scream right when you ... you know .
i'll need the big fingerprint kit ... and the one-to-one polaroid , the cu - 5 , with film packs and batteries .
let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need .
this is a different world - is what i tell myself . a different life . and here i am a different wife .
what ?
here ...
at that moment , at that block party , she represented everything holy about a virgin .
criminal
over there ! two more of them !
christ , i'm getting bored .
- okay okay .
but ...
you got the money ?
pull up alongside .
we talk different ?
how's uncle sibeal ?
you're chasing a dream .
i can't ... make it ... podner .
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers .
we should have just ignored him .
ok . see : frank tj macky is earl partridge's son ...
great day . at last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future .
i ain't no more a preacher , you know .
you've earned it - - the horse ranch on the toulomoe - - the girl in the spotted gingham .
hopefully , it won't get that far .
oh .
elsa . elsa don't . elsa . elsa . give me your other hand , honey . i can't hold you .
you're so full of shit .
not likely . once , yeah , i was - - but there wasn't an inch of profit in it , and i'm a cash oriented girl , if you take my meaning . i'm a hired gun , same as the rest of you , and that's all any of us needs to know about the other .
i have had many excellent meals there .
that's the problem with this case . everyone thinks they know jason's life story . but they don't . what you're remembering is a _movie_ . fiction . in the movie , jason's mother runs around , killing people after jason drowns in crystal lake
i came to feed your fish . i didnt know ...
if you need anything , just ...
nobody can be that busy .
sorry , i just design the maze . keeping the keys secure is your job .
wait for what ? until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to - -
' threw ' you ? where ?
no . well , her grandparents are down in oklahoma , but that's it ...
i am dubious , but i don't welsh . meet me at the stuck pig . seven o'clock . you're late , i walk . so help me , if i find out you cheated .
now go over there and get those digits .
rick , i'm going to flag a cab .
... hey , somebody ! open up , it's me , macready ...  ... come on , damn it ... the towline snapped . been crawling around like a seal out here ...
and it's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it - - is to take out a subscription to your magazine . i guess i'm not the girl i thought i was .
slow down , kid .
you've won with the two chips you placed earlier , but the third chip was a late bet .
she looks like she stinks .
last time i didn't .
fine . i'll do the shopping .
thank you very much . i always try my best .
i'm interested in showing jean's work .
i hate her . i really hate her .
i have on occasion disobeyed orders .
what course , skipper ?
it must be about that appalling script of hers . what can i say to her ? what can i say ?
you share a place with t-bone ?
today ... with dejesus . that was smart thinking to get him inside ...
can we talk about this when i get back ?
don't look at my ass !
it's alright . grant's one of the good guys .
oh , how sweet .
i can still feel its weight . if you could have felt it , not just seen it ...
your work , the layers of irony .
well ?
what ?
this is dangerous . i'm sending backup .
no . nothing bad's going to happen . anne'll be there . i'll be there . nothing bad will happen .
what are you talking about . how do you know ? i need her ! i need her . she needs me . i've got to get to her .
and when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of them is that your idea ?
if she does it'll be a miracle outa scripture .
would you care to join me for a little refreshment ?
roger meris , steps up , it's a corker down the pipe ...
it should be back from your face - - with a bun at the neck . i told them . i told you .
don't let longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas . if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you , you'll be just as dead ... and so will max .
thats not a story , alex . it's a corpse .
agnes , what happened to the baby ?
you , sister ...
that's none of your goddamn business , caesar .
thanks . what's in there ?
don't really have the market for something like this ... i can go two ... two-fifty .
yes , sir . the base commander , general ripper , selected plan-r ?
you're still a little ... disoriented .
i don't know .
i don ' need a hospital ... i feel fine .
i wish that doctor'd come . how do you feel ?
i wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening .
ok .
if you win , you know , you have to stay . it's the losers who get to go home . besides , i'm not so sure it is over . centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines .
did you see my father ?
i'm glad you have such confidence in me .
i give you full marks for bravery - - don't make yourself a fool .
you are the devil ! you are the instrument of satan !
not even for a minute ! general carter , sir , i'd like you to reconsider your choice . i'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind .
but what if sarris survives ?
oh , come on , we're not children . i didn't have anything to do with this fidelity nonsense and you know it .
alright , alright ! we were just fucking with him .. you know ?
nothing .
she's good enough for me ! and if i was to go home and tell my wife - -
twelve hours and forty-three minutes , present speed .
well , they didn't think too much of ' em in paree .
i've got news for you - - i never intended to marry him .
what ? why ?
aunt barbara . i love you , but you're not gonna get it .
i can get another one going . y'know , hey , whatever you want me to - -
hey , what's the matter ... betty , wake up ! why are you staring at me like that ?
richie said he was coming after me tonight .
sometimes right when you're looking at them .
then you use your <u> soup spoon </u> .
uh huh .
what time did you leave ?
standard for a mayfair marriage . rowan - there is a codicil concerning the mayfair assets . they must be ... aahhh ... held separate from the other party ... michael that is it's in the will - for centuries . tradition enjoins , rowan . of course , future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
all right then . it's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment . will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything ?
no , mickey , i can't let you get away with that shit . answer the question . was it worth it ? you haven't seen , heard , or smelled mallory in a year . was it worth it ?
are you threatening me ?
and we didn't have to bring another present ?
operations building . far end of the street .
- - a wash and set .
i think not . but i don't wish my prize to be damaged . we'll test it first . bring in captain solo .
i am only insinuating that you are nervous .
it's about the burglary .
whatever , you come recommended . we ...
you win ! okay pull over .
well , what should we do ?
i didn't think so .
all right , peter . good night .
from who ?
well , what do you expect from a pig but a grunt .
for your information , frank cares what was in those ponds ' cause he used to spend half his day wading around them . that was his job .
i see .
good idea . marko . we're hungry .
the dishes are juiced up , too .
that , my dear conway , is the story of a remarkable man .
fine , thank you . the bathroom is down at the end of the hall .
you're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular .
hey , hey , hey , i'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition - - that's crossing the line !
not you too
that's just why i'm going .
all right . hold on .
because i don't want to see him hurt .
then fight back . get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth .
right .
you burned the score ?
say anything in there about karen sisco ?
it does , huh ? clark kent , i'd like you to meet lois lane .
tell me .
call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock .
so it didn't feel ... weird ?
hah !
fabric and fringe .
you must be high . uh-huh . no way .
i wasn't made for this .
oh .
who ?
i want to see you , too .
please be quiet for a while , would you ?
never . why do you ask ?
what does this mean to you ?
captain ...
did i buy you that dress , you piece of shit ?
how did you know our nanny's name is ... lucky guess !
all this talk about love , it's silly .
let him go .
would it help if i got out and pushed ?
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit .
i think i got one today .
so ? i never returned your calls , even when we were married . and what's fisher doing here anyway ?
no way ...  ... i wanna rock !
he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way . when he was watching from the woods . why didn't he use it to go through the basement door ?
we need you on the inside , my child . to report on his comings and goings , and if need be , to ... destroy him ...  ... for lack of a better word .
damn that charlie i
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown .
technically and biologically , though he'll never recover .
very good . how did you know ?
wanna come ?
can you make out any pattern in all that ?
no ... no you're wrong .
well we can definitely call the police . that's an easy call . if we call the police ... what happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom ... they ask us ... what happened ? we say , ah ... our friend , micheal ... your brother ... got a little out of control ... they were making love ... and he got a little excited ... and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose ...
that's where he'll be .
more wine , sister ? surely you can drink more than that .
no , doctor .
come on serafine . let's go out . show me the real paris , the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with german tourists .
you're right , kid , clemenza is okay . it was paulie .
i'm sure there is , but my young friend here , would <u> kill </u> you .
well , why not ! ? that's exactly how everything works . how else could the city stay in balance - - you have a better idea ?
that girl was amanda krueger . her child - -
so ...
don't ever call me ' irwin , ' okay ?
i know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
yeah , sweet . that's a nice way of putting it .
i did not know , so when i heard you were coming , i asked him that myself .
what are you talkin ' about ?
mister mcmurphy !
... he must have heard the name from those t . v . ' s in the hall that were blaring all the time . i remember guevara was in town at the time . must've heard it from there i guess ... but that's funny , isn't it ?
max something . i got no clue where she stays .
what about our quota ?
was the trip normal in every respect ?
why should i ask someone out who i don't want to go out with in the first place ?
yes .
that's great . let's do a take .
a load of amphetamine i told him i had .
he's a patient here .
okay i'll see you tomorrow night then .
what ?
aha - very good , freshie . [ 3 ] very good . you'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later .
why don't you get to the point .
i got twenty bucks says you're full of shit .
all right , then . i'll tell them .
to keep what's up there from getting down here ! it's not the radiation i'm worried about .
i don't want you to walk--i want to carry you . should i put the top up ? it might get cold .
is this because of those kids who used to beat you up ?
pop ?
what of it ?
this is where it happened . right over here .
not at all .
you're actually having sex with your own little girl ? is that possible ?
no , i mean we can't <u> land </u> for another two hours . fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains . we've got to go through to chicago !
yes , then , you're saying that you <u> haven't </u> bid upon these drawings .
very serious ?
too many . and you've got a new guest . a movie star from hollywood .
how do you mean ?
- after all , the other day was one scene , the woods are full of one scene sensations . but you did it . with work and patience , you'll be a fine actress . if that's what you want to be .
want to ask him ?
what's the name of it ?
you not ugly .
mr . gower , i think . . .
this is a photo of hair .
i thought you'd be thrilled . you're being taken seriously .
apocalypse , end of the world , armageddon . its always got a face and a name .
anyway , i'm surprised alan got the policy so easily . i know there's a history of cancer in the family .
that's what i thought .
well - - last night was not so good .
for five thousand ?
we were attacked by a werewolf .
you've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost . don't you know you should never let them see you sweat . y'knowwhati'msayin ' ?
you stupid bastard . you havn't got any arms left .
i'm surprised donna didn't say anything .
that's my good boy .
you getting this ?
damn god !
that ought to be fun .
what do you think he saw ?
oh ... okay .
you prefer women ?
i guess i might as well get this done with .
i don't let myself think about it , even - - but i do know the part so well , and every bit of the staging , there'd be no need to break in a new girl - - but suppose i had to go on one night ? to an audience that came to see margo channing . no , i couldn't possibly ...
" fun ? " jesus , " <u> fun </u> ? " i kill myself for a year and a half , hand you the best case of your life on a god damn silver platter , remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place , and you think of me as " fun ? "
three .
alexander ... ?
i don't know , honey . i guess it would depend .
what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean ?
why ?
you can't fit in here - - i can't fit in there . according to you , people should be born , live an die on the same - -
you don't think so ? you either did or your didn't .
what does he say ?
on which planet ... ?
what ?
i don't know , i'm waiting for the transcript .
yes , it's so nice i thought i'd work outside .
where to ?
once the tests come back , is there someone i can reach in your office for the results ?
what's that ?
thanks . want'a bite ? mcdonald's vegiroll .
i can't feel my body .
yes !
and they have very mixed feelings about women . they hate them in a way . one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently . they can scrog them , as you say - - for revenge .
i wish i could be that way .
you better hold off on the bubbly .
you got your own nightclub ?
you know the kids aren't really in danger . this is about rachel , and you're right , i'm disappointed in her learning curve , and ...
saber tooth tiger !
did he touch you ?
glory hallelujah .
you know what they say about men who need big guns ...
oh , thank you , sir .
i know .
hunhh ? nothing .
- - that really was incredibly work you did . you and your brother , fighting fires together , helluva image , isn't it ? you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command .
where ... here ?
cease fire ! withdraw !
i'm gonna call him .
yes .
they'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs .

i'm telling you , baby , you always double down on an eleven .
he's wandering around the house , and nell heard him . she thought it was ghosts . let's go look for him again .
so that's the way it is ?
you mean ...
you talked to me . do you remember ?
there goes my chance with sid .
but , bruce , don't keep it in your wallet ! ... well , you see - - - - there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you - - you put in the lining of your hat . that brings you good luck for ten years .
businessman !
is there only one charles lampert ?
jamie ! get away !
good .
it is from love .
come on--we're taking off .
an exhaust system or a window is code .

yes , i've seen it before .
eddie , are you okay ?
turnbull is a good man .
that's my name , maximillions . don't wear it out , babe , or i'll make you buy me a new one .
i know you believe that .
it acts as a ...
of course--everything they asked - -
his wife's in the hospital , has been for a couple months . the big c .
well , terrorists of course .
yeah . i ... i fell asleep . i can't believe it . i - -
riddick ? how close ?
dickie did it .
wow . you wanna grab a bite ?
who ?
who is pamela landy ?
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . don't you , grace ?
no , it isn't . i called off my wedding all because of you .
we've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet . cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten . i'd like you to go with her .
do you ?
i swear , sometimes , you just want to hold onto somebody ! judy , what am i going to do ? i can't go home again .
uh-huh .
we said a hundred .
nothing .
yeah . i've got it here in this bag . i thought i should bring it to you .

a new pair of panty hose . is it enough ?
then - - those are not your own words ?
kill myself .
liza ?
wanna join your little friend ?
look at that right eye .
what ?
better living through chemistry , that's my motto .
- - christ , i wish i knew if we should print this - -
i know . it's--violet .
they found the safe .
you'll forgive my impertinence , sir , but even though we had never before met , always considered you as a father to me .
she did like you , she helped and trusted you ! you paid her back by trying to take bill away !
hmm ? is that a professional opinion ?
yeah . it seems a little crazy , but sometimes <u> you just know </u> . she's perfect for me .
or just plain stupid . you'd think by the twentieth time , i'd have found an alternative method . maybe a more effective one , if you know what i mean .
you're through with one night stands ? ! what do you want ?
if you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway , maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes .
uh , no ... i should be on the bridge .
you hear that , terry ? terry , did you hear that ? you lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war . all you gotta do is walk .
father -
back is in new york .
i had a checklist in mind . i thought that if babies were on the plane , the plane couldn't crash . but all the babies were crying , and i thought they knew something i didn't .
what's the bible for ?
why'd you want to help us ?
weston dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat . you remember that ?
don't worry about it , pal .
his only kid .
she was always a rotten wife ! she was against everything manly you ever wanted to do . he was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time , and his wife made him quit . she made him become a life insurance salesman instead .
you did the right thing .
i want to do it right .
it was bad .
i - - i don't know , dear ... perhaps there's some mistake .
mr . cedar is , and i haven't seen him in two days . listen , cedar , we've got to do something about the newspapers .
yes .
' take me ' ... ? where ?
nicer than most .
some other time .
following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend .
original .
yeah . i was in nam .
you know , i've got a perfect little spot here for " brian mccaffrey , fireman " ...
what are you talking about , raymond ? cosmo can't own the moon .
coffee and whiskey , lucky you ain't dead with that diet . wait , i've got it . half fried chicken with fries . let's go , hurry up . come on .
wake up ? saturday is the lone day i get to sleep late .
i'll rent the truck from you . you can stay here , you can go . whatever you want .
really ? maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last !
i bet he will . i got a little money if he don't . i'll get ' em for ye .
yes ?
i guess all the suspects are here .
that'll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i'll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?
leo has to take the journey , cooch .
my son ?
i'm at the las vegas . behind the dance hall . do you know a man called albert swift ?
you're not ?
oh , you're not so badly off . there's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife .
- - thanks , coach - -
no .
what ?
here's yours .
i've got a good lock on my door . and bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight .
no . you know too many sick ladies .
go away .
the old man's screwy !
that's a thick change of heart .
stop it .
you probably <u> do </u> want to be killed by it , that was you trying to meet your maker .
i don't think so . no sir , we're closed .
why is that , do you think ?
it's a starting place .
he will . i know he will .
it looks real . i don't know anything about guns .
this isn't a courtroom . don't try to turn this around on me .
why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage ?
we've got to get him out of here .
i've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen .
who was that at the door ?
oh , no .
where did he go ?
what ?
can we put rebecca lawson at the scene ?
do as i say .
young man , stop right there !
i hope there's a place to land .
done . in fact , i was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs .
will it track back to us ?
he's been stealing my cats to experiment on [ them ] . i know cause i've been [ watching ] spying on him .
no , no - - i - - i just thought you hurt yourself .
no , sir .
don't toy with floris , schwartz . why , if i were eighty years younger , i'd box your ears .
one of the printers .
the plane is fine .
why would you want to leave ?
is the line sinking ?
are you licensed to broadcast , buddy ?
what with ?
in the service you do , but we're not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we're doing , that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
i'm falling ! i'm going to fall !
and what you're wearing , that's great , too .
didn't they tell you ?
get off of me you cripple !
i'd like this cashed , please .
i told you , i'm good at this .
with pleasure ... and an honor . did you hear about nathan hale ?
mother's going to help me with the invitations .
i don't need anything from you . i was laying on a beach somewhere in spain , naked , and , it hit me - - nickie's birthday . so , here i am , four layovers , twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later . not necessarily in that order .
i'm just kidding .
we don't discuss it .
nobody's shooting nobody ... come on , just let us through the hatch !
where are you ?
can i buy this otis redding single off you ?
okay .
don't call me stupid .
hi , dad !
i'm married .
yeah , well you wrote me you were six - foot-four , baby . so don't talk to me about little white lies .
what's it like ?
oh , i do . you made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash . your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized .
that's right .
i don't want him hurt ...
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . the civilian does not .
it's ... slowing down , sir .
what's he joking around for ? he's been shot .
it's a wonder you aren't . i'm amazed , eric . i barely lasted 30 hours . you lasted eight weeks .
i am an experiment ? i am freako ?
aren't you afraid of me ?
you're a young man . you're romantic . you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together . you think a soft voice means a soft heart . you'll grow out of that .
never did catch your name .
we'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything , duane will be right outside the door .
we're piecing together different accounts and ...
this is my project . i say ' action . ' i am the director ! you are the talent . you wait for me to say ' action . ' and ' action ! '
then this is it .
accident my ass . i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here .
they were auditioning for the same role as you ?
i don't drink .
a gun's a gun man . it don't need to be loaded .
desmond .
have to talk about something .
good evening , dr . lechter . thank you for coming . i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances .
well , isn't this a coincidence .
whose side are you on , cauchon ?
ten , sir , and make them short ones , do you hear , captain grogan ?
... what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears ? this is a ... why ? why would you do that ?
yes . i wrote it .
but how could he know ? he only just met me .
here's how i see it . i've got no house , no movie , no gun , and i'm being stalked . because someone wants to kill me ? no , because someone wants to kill you . so now , starting now , i go where you go . that way , if someone wants to kill me , i'll be with you , and since they really want to kill you , they won't kill me , they'll kill you . make sense ?
he says he's too hot . he doesn't even know i came here today . it's like he's crazy . jimmy .
what else is there ?
look , buddy-boy - - if there wasn't a lady present , i'd clobber you .
well , then--i--i don't feel i can stay , sir .
then you * did * say it .
they did not !
she okay ?
give me it .
what ?
only one way to find out .
i don't know . motel ... abby - -
you're getting obvious .
shut up .
can't i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ? the world is not black and white . show me one perfect person . if you can't , don't ask me to be .
calm down , bud .
are we supposed to ?
how do you want me to play it ? i'm broke .
so they said more than the address .
inspector halloran , homicide . i'm in charge here .
as i said , sir , we've got all the people we need .
you know my name .
i didn't know ... i didn't ... it was so lovely ... he was in my lap like ... like a baby ... and ... i ...
i know . i write like a child .
don't forget your towel .
fine , maybe you're right . but it doesn't friggin ' matter . i can't afford a star , so i don't even know what we're talking about .
i know , i know .
philip ! the senior partner ?
<u> expected </u> ... offer .
uh-huh .
larry , i'm a businessman , trying to make a buck like anybody else .
you sold it ? i thought they stole it .
there was a another surge in the bio - readings right before you ... you saw what you saw . we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged . what if there were a connection between the two ? the gravity waves , the hallucination , all part of an defensive reaction , like an immune system ...
shouldn't he be at home ?
i'm sorry . it's not up to me .
are you kidding ? i wouldn't miss this for all the tea in china .
did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question ?
no .
... i .. uh .. i get to read some of the books but mostly i .. just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback . after paperback it's basically someone else's problem .
no , icky , this is real .
i know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
i don't know if you don't know - -
we're damaged goods .
german , is that you ?
think again .
no , that's not it .
ahh , that's right , like one big happy family . this is nick's room and uhh ...
very good .
what was i doin ' up there makin ' a speech , anyway ? me ? huh ? gee , the more i think about it the more i could . . .
you're thinking ... ?
sound a little what ?
is that any way to say hello ?
we'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role .
who are you kidding , doc ? you or me ?
is she coming back ?
it's nice .
ain't <u> that </u> the truth .
this isn't possible ...
yes , yes ... let's talk about that ... your roots ... your father is from haiti , isn't he ?
i had a witness disappear on me .
bye .
some kind of power failure . maybe it's the storm . do you have a flashlight ?
tonight . when you get out , we'll go . why didn't you tell the other detective ?
all day .
i've been dreading you .
jesus of nazareth found the holy among the profane . if we are to have a place of private prayer , where better than here , beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river ?
it's alright , dad .
i don't know , maybe i wasn't clear . but i thought ... i told you to keep your mouth shut .
sir , there's something else ... a transat relay . just came through .
i didn't see anything .
i don't know you . but you . i never forget a face . mister chekov , isn't it ? i never thought to see your face again .
how do we know they've got cancer ? could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
all right , then , and we'll be off . nice chatting with you .
i've seen it before .
shit , that's what keeps people alive .
i was just saying , i'm going to cable downing street , see if i can't stir up a few shillings - katharine's mother and the pm's wife are best -
there you go again ! how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument ?
repeat that , bill .
- - anna - -
jos - maybe you should turn it down .
no , i don't belong here .
he's gone , hasn't he ?
there you go again - - you know i didn't mean it that way , fran . just get well - - do what the nurse tells you - - i mean baxter - - and i'll see you as soon as i can . bye , fran .
come on .
" we'll all have lunch . " good idea . oh , and let's be sure to invite this sociologist , too - - just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards !
hey ...
speak up , please .
who wants true ? who wants moving ?
hello .
you're crazy . i can't--i can't-no . no .
you know so much . they've got christy , and we've got to find her . get her 8x10 , from in front of the lounge . fax it to every contact we got .
there is no letter .
well , it's the funny man . give it here , package boy .
morning . sometime .
the subject got emotionallv disturbed ; he just dropped out . there's thousands .
it's monstrous - - it grew , like some horrible tapeworm . we were completely unprepared .
but sir - -
good morning , julius . how's our patient today ?
oh . right . yeah . that's , uh upstairs . uh . here . powwow safe .
you gold-teeth , gold-chain-wearing , fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin ' , monkey , ape , baboon , big thigh , fast-running , three-hundred-sixty - degree-basketball-dunking spade moulan yan .
can't move .
mr . fennyman , because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play . i am writing an apothecary , a small but vital role .
so , he sent you , gave you the money , his errand-boy . and if you refused , it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film . that's the beauty of lawyer / client privilege .
have you ever had anal intercourse ?
please , no apologies . i've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos . you'll have round-the clock care .
this one's going to be even more fun .
you were prying before ?
you're doing just fine .
well , press something !
what didn't you like about her ?
and this is helen carter .
how ?
uh .
yes , my master .
yeah . drowning .
sam , i'm going .
what do you hear ?
well , you're to take these after you've eaten . now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills ?
and charming ?
craig , remember what i told you .
do you mind if i ask who you are ?
you take things too seriously . look at us , we're cruising around , talking , taking some quiet time , getting paid for it . we've got a good job here .
how are you ? what's that you're working on , johnny ?
riordan ?
do you know what ed gein said about women ?
you said whatever it was you would understand .
- - haldeman i know , who else ?
what do you want ?
johnny , why won't you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
he's blessing the house .
yeah .
oh yeah , since when ?
i don't have any sugar either .
20,000 ? ! but ... i heard king charles was ... financially embarrassed .
you're saying stay away from him .
what are you doing here ?
i'm tellin ' ya , i'm giving you all i know .
yes .
he's better dead . i know he was mixed up - but not like that .
what ? do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear ?
he was insane , baby : a mad dog . i put him out of his misery - -
wayne , if it was anybody else - - -
well , then , i'll tell you what i'd do . i'd jump daisy into the river , and swim you both across , where no enemy could follow us .
that's what mr . miyamoto reported , and he'd have no reason to lie . he couldn't know that it would help his case .
well , i guess i got it wrong , then . seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him .
" i'm telling you god's words , not to hustle . "
i've been carrying you our whole fuckin ' lives .
so tell me .
she's only known the guy a few months .
do you want i send it to your room ?
i picked him up and i fucked him . i'm a bad girl .
you probably won't believe me .
okay , thanks .
you musta seen him get shot . i know you did .
dr . lizardo's a raving lunatic , perfect tommy , a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours .
he wasn't even in the car ?
there's a big diner about ten miles on up ... just outside fairvale .
come on , move it !
uh .. you're welcome .
is the veronica lake look-alike one of your whores ?
well someone clearly let him out before monica opened the gate .
there's some weird shit here .
you said something to him , didn't you ?
ah , you fuck ! you're such a fuckin ' asshole !
... it looked money .
every place has hookers , but if this hotel has hookers , they don't look like they're ...
shut up .
no . why ?
goddam you . gimme that bag ,
in london those radical ideas could land you in newgate prison . why were those people living in this defenseless place ... ?
let go ! let go of me . oh my god , it's cops !
put the bolts on that window under a scope , i'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them .
i said i wouldn't .
... in the morning .
bad coffee , and women with excessive ankles .
i'm doing fine . theo wants to deal .
that is the point ... and skipper'll slip off the hook .
all of them .
she's just a kid . there's time for more babies later . after she grows up .
he's done it before . other countries . lumumba in the congo , trujillo , the dominican republic , he's working on castro . no big deal . in september , kennedy announces the texas trip . at that moment , second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket . y flies in the assassins , maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens , greece - pros , maybe some locals , cubans , maria hire , separate teams . does it really matter who shot from what rooftop ? part of the scenery . the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone ...
... i cannot confirm the existence of praxis .
yes . perhaps he would at that .
it ain't done , if that's what you mean .
that's the trouble with you boys ! don't listen when a man tells you something .
here ?
but also very young . six to one is no odds , boy .
bob is dead , tyler . the police blew a hole in his head . was that part of your plan ?
what ?
peter , i ... i ...
i am preparing for a ball !
mmm , i love cristal , let's have some .
begging your pardon , i haven't been down the bowery in years !
i'm not thinking about your future , paden . i'm worried about stella .
good . where are we ?
i didn't know barry had a beach house .
hi , wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow ?
you're a stuttering stanley !
the system . but i'm not afraid to die , doctor . i'm dying for what i believe .
that's the man . he's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan . him and his family owned these islands ' round here . they was leasin ' this one to the fed . the whole underneath is dug out . there was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing , nuclear power , all o ' that . now this is dickerson's ... gasparilla's ... private fortress . him and a bunch o ' his cronies from all the best golf courses in tallahassee ... and his private army , of course .
that thing is poisonous .
it's a shame . he's such a rest actor , and nobody uses him anymore .
i'll tell you what you're gonna do . you're gonna stay put like taylor said .
but one must love a father .
that we're dumber than we look .
my secret diary . there are pages missing .
you didn't do your homework ?
i am one , dad !
oh , just stop it ! you knew this was going to happen . he's a young man .
i presume you shall . this won't be my last visit here .
worms was comin ' out .
was that it ? well , ok .
when there is , you can forget about it . and i swear to god , you ever talk about my daddy again i'm gonna kick your bank-telling , loan-denying ass , you got me ?
i heard .
if you free me , you'll be a rich man ...
no , i'm okay .
really ?
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone .
smells funny , it being mentioned in the paper .
ah - - i see . no , i'm afraid mine are the o'higgins of watertown .
i'm just being realistic .
what on earth gave you that idea ?
lots of my clients are rich guys ... they like danger .. like playing with drugs and things ... running around , acting mysterious .
we used to sing it in school . don't look at me with such horror . they had schools in those days .
what family ? we never heard from them . i sold her house for them , made them money .
wasn't that cowardice ?
no . this isn't what you think .
oh , the whole family loved him . of course , they loved the last guy i went out with , and he strung me along for three years and dumped me .
what brought this on ?
- we made a fire .
great idea . let me get some shoes . i'll take you home .
the bar at the hotel ? she told you that ? what did she say exactly ?
you know their workforce . two-thirds at least fall into the category . we'll be closing down their operation for days . at least go with a fingertip sample or urine .
i'll be right back . stay put .
you know what gets me ?
... gruber's not bad.galvin not bad ... ? this guy's dr . kildare , the jury's going to love him , mick ... and you calm down , all right ? their guy , towler's , the author of the book , ' methodology and practice , anesthesiology . ' ... and they got depositions from the nurses , everybody in the operating room , the scrub-nurse ... ' all these guys are god . i saw them walk on water ... '
around here .
' lo , ed .
well , how ' bout that ?
where are you going ? ! we need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals !
ask me to meet you again , jimmy .
no , thank you ... and i'm afraid now i really must be going .
i've designed and built six of these places - - take my word for it , everything's fine .
could you please do me a big favor ? in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess . could you look and tell me what they are ?
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him ?
and get your bone smooched .
you have heard your answer , monsieur le marquis .
what's that ?
you're afraid of germs ?
after we corroborate it . that's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show . anything else ?
so , you were bored ? is that how this blessed miracle came to be ?
then why did you go see mr . koehler in the first place ?
i don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy . you've been real square dealin ' with me . the bible says two men ort not lay together . but i'll bet you the good lord wouldn't send nobody like you to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades . that boy lives inside of his own heart . hits an awful big place . you take care of that boy .
how did you know ?
disappointing , isn't it ? to come so far and find so little . jaded ingenues , amusing themselves with make - believe ...
no shit ?
what do you mean ?
what am i , a method actor ? hans , babe , put away the gun . this is radio , not television ...
won't you change your mind , sir ? what can i say to convince you ?
john doe , the one in the speech .
alvy , i can't say that that's true at this point in my life . i really just can't say that that's true . i mean , you know how wonderful you are . i mean , you know ... you're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing , and-and - and , you know , get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap . anyway , look , i don't wanna - listen , listen , listen , uh h'h , so whatta you up to anyway , huh ?
i dunno . yeah ! yeah ! yeah ! i did .
can you fly that thing .
yeah - -
where are we going ?
what ?
yah , well , they exist all right .
whoopie fucking doo .
there was some sophistos from the tv studios around the corner , laughing an govoreeting . the devotchka was smecking away , and not caring about the wicked world one bit . then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out , and in the short silence before the next one came on , she suddenly came with a burst of singing , and it was like for a moment , o my brothers , some great bird had flown into the milkbar and i felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise , athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again . because i knew what she sang . it was a bit from the glorious 9th , by ludwig van . dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl , followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air , followed by a clowny guffaw . alex brings his stick down smartly on dim's legs .
hindenburg ...
your first boyfriend . what do you think ? any sparks left ?
i am done with theatre . the playhouse is for dreamers . look where the dream has brought us .
men , they mostly faggots .
meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants ?
how you doing , man ?
that bothers you ?
gibarian . he was here .
what if i
i'm sure it's lovely .
it's just that there's less that adam and ryan can do anymore . i'd hate to have them bored .
i am not ... a guerilla fighter , toby . i'm not a pioneer . i'm not ... i'm not strong that way . i need ...
i was just scared is all .
i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed .
yes .
i can't do that . and i appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in - law , and i do want to help you and i like to do favors , and i know who you are , but i cannot do that .
why not ? he has great pants .
our best scientific minds already have . we can't find any other way to do this .
so you paid the guy ?
this looks promising ...
the monroe ?
we each face death every day we're alive , saavik .
with the forty thousand dollars ?
jesus , i got a hangover . want a drink ?
jeanne , calm down , do you hear me ? are you alright ?
go on ! get out ! i can fight this thing all alone !
that's right - - you're a left-brain word fetishist .
hey !
you're ruining my life ' because you won't be normal , i can't be normal .
the what ?
no ... no doctor ...
i'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing . i'll call marcello santos .
anything i can do back here ?
what do you mean , flop sweat ? - - you're making too much out of it ... i'll bet you were the only one aware of it ...
hey , sam , we're flat broke .
let me drive you home .
come on , doom . what would a company like that want with toontown ?
when did you first do business with this bertrand ?
why can't you come ...
saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for jeff tomorrow . there's only one thing that can be done for him now - - i--i've written his resignation . he resigns under protest--denying all charges . no one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not . it leaves him with at least a shred of honor . the other way--branded openly in the senate--expelled--he'll never live it down . rather a simple compromise than utter ruin . in a year--the whole thing might be forgotten - -
hildy !
good .
oh , ellen ! i've been wondering when you'd come . why don't you step in .
she - she said i - i was a - - -
this is your bed . you may leave your things in that cabinet .
i'm sorry , darling , have you seen my coffee mug ... ?
i think i'll see hat action .
what's that ?
no . here's fine .
uncle terrence , you're ...
hunting and trapping was a damn fine life . me and mitchell , bob and lemalle , we were teams . i'd always go with mitchell . good man , mitchell . i'd let bob worry about goddamn lemalle . we'd hire a plane in october . on the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere , we'd drop supplies . we'd land , tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before christmas .
here's the surgeon .
i'm not sleepy anymore . let's drive for a little while longer .
then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long .
we playing cards tonight ?
you know what we're saying !
you're going to kill him ? kill morpheus ? !
entert-ain ... us ... an-us ... oh yeah ! heh heh . anus . heh heh .
darling , you've got the wrong idea .
oh , no . sometimes i have dinner with ed sullivan , sometimes with dinah shore or perry como - - the other night i had dinner with mae west - - of course , she was much younger then . cheers .
now exactly . it's ... complicated .
well . congratulations .
of course ! roy bensinger , the poet . of course you wouldn't know ! you probably never heard of shakespeare , either ! put mr . bensinger right on the staff . how much are you getting on the tribune , roy ?
look at the sign . ' hell ' ? in the festival of love ? you make any sense in that ?
mollie , drop down here ! you've fainted !
we are only moving six hundred people , jean-luc .
care to indulge ?
you know what i've been doing since i got home ? been working on a poem . it's about you . sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so i write ' em .
no , it's an old football injury .
that's okay .
lovely bouquet . after our last case , vince took me out for a draft beer . as i recall we split the check .
stop . just wait . who's the victim ?
all right .
i'll sleep good tonight knowing that .
three .
i'd cut it ...
i'll give you the money to go . i don't want you to take any from those guys .
it ain't only local history , sam , it's the only murder-and-suicide case in fairvale ledgers ! mrs . bates poisoned this guy she was ... involved with , when she found out he was married , then took a helping of the same stuff herself . strychnine . ugly way to die .
but we have to match the other sketch .
my god ! wha-what is this ? the gestapo ? no .
what is that to you ? evil as you are .
excuse me ?
helena - -
i moved the couch . that's all .
you do it .
yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges .
that's exactly what we don't have , doctor .
sure .
you can hold back this months pay-check until i come through with the story .
and this , only one of these letters , major . i have lots of them .
if he were only that . the man's evil himself . some day you'll know him as macfarlane knows him - - for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him . that brought him close to gray , he roistered with him and drank with him . aye , and gray even brought him to my door and my love . there is all that between them and more - - burke and hare and knox - -
and then what ? then you'll be safe ?
jack wells . a museum sent you ?
friends like these , huh gary .
sometimes .
okay . see you later .
i swear .
i'd like that very much .
yeah . someone like you who divides his time , fairly evenly , between the batting cages and bars .
... no ...
what ? no , rose , jesus , no - -
wuddya mean , buddy ?
no problem , vinnie . everything's under control . i could run this store in my sleep .
yes . how did you know ?
after i got the shit beat out of me !
what , lewis ?
to learn to shoot cannon ?
he filed half of them , he filed the big one . all the little ones , i have , i have to go back and ... ah , fuck , i got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the ... i mean , talk about a bad streak . that would sap anyone's self confi ... i got to go out and reclose all my ... where's the phones ?
to talk ? well , ok , that might be good .
who's the nut ?
no no no .
what can i get you ?
sure . but eventually , even the more serious-minded birds began to listen . " why should humans rule ? " they asked themselves .
forget it - - i didn't do it as a doctor - - i did it as a neighbor . by the way , whatever happened to her ?
looked like an interview to me .
i told you - - he and i were old friends - -
le montage , lemballage . not your regular street muck , is it ? this is collectors stuff . how much would it cost me ?
where's kelly ?
didn't ya think , mary ?
peter webber ! right . quite the spotlight on that guy .
wait there .
you are about to witness something few have seen - - watch ! watch !
if you want to come in and wash your face - i can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
can't help it . you're doing time for me . no greater love , as the man says . wish you'd tell me why .
when i get off work .
my bags are out there in that white cadillac convertible . can you have someone drive it around to the room ?
i don't like this .
what about the wife ?
where did you send the message to peter kurten ?
is there any truth to what he's saying , pike ?
she likes you okay .
you said we were on the same programming team .
why should you think i wouldn't be ?
oh . nothing ... sitting .
yes .
just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
he ... didn't have me .. i told you -
some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions . you rushed in with no thought to the consequences , to yourself or anyone else . you're no better than the people who built this place .
as far as i know .
a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days .
you ?
why are they doing this ?
ken .
no . she just stayed with us . like she did all along .
would you , really ? how sweet -
gross . what is it ?
he's dead . an accident . hit by a bus .
absolutely not .
oh ... god ... am i cold ...
no can do .
i think i went in and fell asleep . i guess gregory walked home and got killed ! i blacked out .
undercover .
you see it your way , i'll see it mine . you need a doctor .
they'll arrest that girl . everything points to her .
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt ?
father saw you die .
yeah , that's why i called . i mean , maybe fed-ex would tell me where she moved - -
not much to tell . i went to public school . went to university on scholarship . went to work for an investment firm . in eight years i owned it . my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after . i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces . one of the pieces was him .
but what if the play was a hit ?
so ? what's he gonna do , arrest us ?
no .
well , honey ... you know that ...
he said to send you his regards and to tell you that the bureau holds you in the highest esteem .
do you always look at it encoded ?
for bravery .
perhaps i'd better start calling you doctor again , mrs . peel - -
you do ?
then i'll write about you .
room service speaking .
yeah .
anything this time ?
you okay ?
me ...
... thanks .
dude . seriously ?
are you telling me they can't see murders anymore ?
not at all .
i'll pick the moment , nick . the game goes on until i move . when i start shooting , go for the nearest guard and get his gun .
why not ?
arnie , i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass .
i don't believe you .
did you ? where ?
yeah , well ... it's finally over .
yeah . another little matter needs attending to soon as i return .
i'd swear something was there sir , but i might have imagined it .
we both do .
you called me .
yes it is .
well - - you sent for me .
yeah . what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory ? six scoop interviews !
money makes the world go round . it ain't no joke being poor . i know whati'mtalkin''bout . y'knowwhati'msayin ' ? i've lived on the street . i've been homeless . i've learned how to play the game , work the game , be in the game .
look !
that next thing there - - six legs , tentacles - - that's the thing we saw in the food locker .
dylan , it's breakfast . not arts and crafts what ?
it's an anagram . it comes from the canons of dort . every letter stands for a different belief . t-u-l-i-p . like - - are you sure you're interested in this ?
oh , thank you very much .
promise me you won't forget tomorrow . you'll remember , won't you ? you won't say that it was just a dream . promise me .
what if we transmitted it over cellular ?
miss ratched . given all the conditions of that sublime relationship , coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred , mentally , physically and emotionally , the only thing that i can speculate on , at this late date , is how i will justify the very existence of my life , with or without my dear wife .
just the damn cable tv company . you know how they are . did you hear about dottie hinkle ?
i hate it here . it's so ugly , it's like being dead . you got out of here , you know ? i'm ready to go .
you like the way i cook ... you think i make out a great invoice . phil you and nick and ... and this ... this garage are my whole life ... i love you . sure you don't have the greatest taste in music ... but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock . what i'm try ... what i'm trying to sa ...
' got a good thing , man .
i'm butcherin ' my hog myself , smokin ' the hams , and cannin ' the sausage . you-all have your work cut out !
why'd you get mixed up with them ? you don't have to prove anything .
get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart .
it's locked on the inside . it's through that passageway and to the right .
if we get him , i'll be happy enough .
why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
sorry . i thought i was doing quite well .
no , we're here to ... rescue them .
maybe someday .
they left . i had to go with them .
i was going to a funny movie , but i changed my mind . if you're depressed , laughing doesn't help much . when did you know my father ?
i can't relax .
and incidental damages , if any ...
well , he has been pushing me to meet his father , but i've been putting it off .
flare up of old emotions ...
obi-wan has taught you well .
i'm moving . remember ? what's with the hooded cloak ?
what'd you want me to do . stay at home , twiddlin ' me thumbs . doing sweet f . a . [ fuck all ] .
i tremble with fear ! you're bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound !
i said . i serve the queen .
kay .
that's right .
what are you doing here ? you're not cleared for this area !
knaves and robbers ...
i don't mind it . it was harder before the war . trying to keep up appearances . now it's patriotic to be poor .
- - mouth-to-mouth , which could maybe ...
well-l ... how do you do , dr . forrester !
i was scared then , not now . how long you want me to be scared ?
on earth , petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders . warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire . we can handle the son'a , i'm not worried about that ...
fuck sides ! what we need is a little solidarity here . somebody's stickin ' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle . now i know i'm no piece of shit ... and i'm pretty sure you're a good boy ... and i'm fuckin positive you're on the level . so let's figure out who's the bad guy .
- - and the fbi confirms--what more do you need ? - -
i got pain an ' experience too .
i asked him .
and you said yes ?
delivered from martha stewart .
good , let's drink up .
is that what happened ? did you even make it out to the desert , or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets ?
all right , get up on that bar and dance .
everybody should have one talent . what's yours ?
best we could do in two hours .
the top of what ?
that's not what i mean .
it's just you and me , then .
you're not a real cop , are you ? just some mercenary who goes around talkin ' about the law like - -
tell me ... where is this rue de thbes ?
an integer .
i see what you mean ... you're a beautiful guy . and you're doing a damn good job .
mom ?
i'm tired of praying .
look here , fettes . not i nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation . i would have to study the matter . have we any " subjects " ?
dr . towler ...
... any idea what's goin ' on here ? !
what do you mean ?
don't get kinky here ...
i brought it ... to the coroner .
i thought i'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to . as a child , i never had no room all to myself , we were awful poor . buddy ... i have got a confession to make .
then we'll go home .
he told me about this . you got this from containment ?
here . you shoot . i'll drive .
why ? !
i thought british policy is ' make the world ... england ' , sir .
but are there ... i mean , how many ...
i think he's a jew .
so that was your pudding ?
my name is diedrickson . county medical examiner .
may i ask why ?
so they can be on tv .
look , i <u> want </u> to forget you , i do . i think if you hold me , just this once , i can walk away and never speak to you again .
that's correct .
that don't hardly say it . he shoots the desk clerk one day , and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel .
you disdain accepted wisdom ?
* and * over the himalayas . that's called flying over the hump .
but this is a porno movie .
more than you know . is there anything else ?
yes .
you're convinced the crew could still be alive ? after seven years ?
it is you , sir , who knows not the virtue of humility , as a true king must .
lemme go ! lemme go ! !
we got divorced . i had to get rid of her . she couldn't satisfy me .
is morally , ethic'ly
one meets so many attorneys in my business . no , i don't believe i know dean andrews .
heather , i feel awful , like i'm going to throw up . can we jam , please ?
hello , tracy .
that's why we're here .
" i guarantee that we'll have tough times . i guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out . but i also guarantee that if i don't ask you to be mine , i'll regret it for the rest of my life . because i know in my heart - - you're the only one for me " .
will your power outward .
she's not in the gaming business is she ?
you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum .
yeah . how long have you been here ?
of course he is . i've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk ...

your hair's cute like that . you should never comb it .
is that her real name ?
prescription . for my condition .
hi , bert .
i need that voucher ! i told you a week ago it was important !
you don't miss much .
then why did you come here ?
yeah . you want to go dancing tonight ?
i don't care . she's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change .
happy now ?
appearances can be deceptive , mrs de moraes .
that way .
i fucked up . i lost control of the situation , the one thing they train you for ... god , what did i do ?
that's good . at least they're interested .

i don't remember .
she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste .
no !
jupiter , actually . well , one of the moons .
no .
i'm going away after that , the next morning .
you're doing fine . i won't let anything happen to you , remember ?
i said you're fired . go on - - get outta here .
' that right ?
what , like on va-kay ?
you really hit a guy with a bottle ?
you can change it if you want to .
i just buzzed him in .
what do i do ?
someone died here . it's tapu .
- well , it's just ...  ... other men don't abandon their wives at such a time -
awright . fire-team a . gear up . let's move . two minutes . somebody wake up hicks .
of course you can have it if you need it . can i get you something to eat ?
a leech on the welfare state in addition . you don't miss a trick .
foul fellow , this couer de noir .
and this class officer ... " wickwire . " you think he was just trying to get even ? striking back for ...
well , are we still on for tonight ?
i'm sorry , but you're not going to die a virgin rod .
we have no choice . send them up ... and start clearing everyone out .
oh my god , sorry . i'm interrupting .
i feel much better now ...
... but you're not - - you're not sure ...
and he said most of them are college guys , i've never met or seen .
marcus ... you'll write something better next time !
you survived the fire swamp . you must be very brave ...  ... but nobody withstands the machine . - - - 69 .
what hard part ?
enough though , eh ?
bruckner's seventh , major .
i was thinking , there's so much i've got to show you when we get through this . it's mind boggling , the pos - sibilities ... disneyland , the beach , movies ... matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs ...
yes , dear !
he let the fucking cop out - - but he won't - -
go get me a beer .
my heart weeps .
oh , jean's okay . but there's three people up in brainerd who aren't so okay , i'll tell ya that .
going out .
no , benjamin . i don't hate him . unhook my blouse .
it's really long left slide , breaks on the short side of the point - - catches a south swell .
cox ! fire him .
what ten thousand ?
but thanks .
look , i'm just guessing ...
jerry ! do something - -
jamie , he's careless . reckless . is this really the best time to be making a new friend ... ?
that's confidential information , little man .
my dear mademoiselle , perhaps you have already observed that in casablanca , human life is cheap . good night , mademoiselle .
is there a mrs . joshua ?
if they're still alive ...
he hasn't got shit all over him .
terry ? what do you want ?
is it possible to go in right after the explosion ?
tell him the channels , dusty .
i thought you were going to let this one through .
it's not the first . there's been several . and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat ... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit .
what else ?
yeah , exactly . those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at .
you've done nothing but study swordplay ?
very well , then .
he probably knows a lot more than that . somebody's lying .
hey it's your roof . it's your fucking problem . hi , uh , there's an emergency down at the circle a on first street , yeah , okay . you're fucked now , pal ! um , send an ambulance ' cause i , i think it's an overdose or something . okay . okay . jeff , they're coming . just wait here . i'm gonna go over to scuff's and see if he's got his truck . listen , if she dies , you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town !
she needs to be changed again . sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as willow changes the baby . soon the baby stops crying . re - lieved yet still anxious , sorsha paces to a mirror . willow rocks the baby gently , absently looking at the fire . then his eyes focus on the fire .
wait for me for when i get round to the front .
i promised chloe we'd come here .
not properly watered .
ahh--then she's still alive .
the what ?

i can just take her right across the street to luther's hotel . all i need is some money for the room .
no way to take another day or two ?

this is it for me .
they tell me you got the cripple from new york in there . he mention keyser soze
<u> cheyenne </u> ! what cheyenne ?
in quite a hurry .
don't start with me again .
said " looks clear . "
easily spoken ...
he'll have to take a check . i couldn't find my wallet .
and now 2,000 women want his number . the guy could be a crackhead , a psychopath , a flasher , a junkie , a transvestite , a chain-saw murderer , or someone really sick , like rick .
what ?
you - - you ! !
the queen has consented ?
of course .
well ... i've been on blind dates before ... matter of fact , to be honest , i've been picked up before . okay .
and no school tomorrow , either . you take a little vacation , relax and rest for a change .
i remember you were in trouble all the time .
how do you know ? personal experience ?
i'll be here .
this the place ?
i was dubious myself at first . then something connected - - the village's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones ...
she can't still be angry at this , it's gotta get better .
what ?
what ?
this is science-fiction robert ! the manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it .
it's in good condition .
in her walkman . it's the one thing i knew she'd be taking .
well you know his blokes'll place the oscor in his annex , where else if you're pinpointing transmitters , video signals , covert chip cameras , anything radiating , oscillating ..
yes . i'd never been in a place like that before .
you are late - - the dancer's gone to the theatre .
i wish you were coming with me .
where you goin ' ! ?
are you crazy ?
damn it , jim , what the hell's the matter ? other people have birthdays . why're we treating yours like a funeral ?
he tried to rob me - - he is dead - -
hey ... wake up .

then how come she knows what's going on ?
good to see you , general . this is pastor collins , director of civil defense . sheriff bogany , head of the local forces ... miss van buren .
what'll it be ?
how did you acquire this , mister laplante ?
about what !
you can't trust melanie . but you can always trust melanie to be melanie .
he left with sophie .

because i want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place . i want you more now than i did that first night - - you've forgotten all that , i suppose ?
yeah .

granville's looking for you anyway .
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ? something so bad ... ?
... i mean , i don't know where he is , but he ain't dead .
are you trying to panic the women ?
look dixon , calm down ! it's not illegal to buy stock or to be right . and it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy . tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment .
bye-bye !
looks like a train ticket .
yeah , harding , where do you breathe anyway ?
no ! no ! don't touch it . that's a very important work of art . what the bloody hell do you want ?
i thought it'd be nicer to eat here .
solid and genuine is not boring . michael can be completely insane ...
but i loved the second one she wore . and this one - - - - is beautiful .
all of them ?
yeah . have you seen telly around ?
can you shut it down ?
look ! janie !
so , the doctor , he has to make the - - - - come se dice ?
it's a white powder that comes in a vial .
on a good day i couldn't spare a crosswalk guard . but now , no way . folks're batshit with the weather turning sour . bring him in yourself .
little early from trick-or-treat , homie . this dick trying to bushwack me .

i took too long .
yeah . hey thanks . that's real nice , travis .
move away , cupcake . he's got a gun .
where is he ?
someone ... maybe they sent an sos !
you fell in love with her first .
i am satan . i am your god , now .
once , about three or four months later . i felt so bad about stealing the camera , i hadn't even used it yet . i finally made up my mind to return it , but granny ethel wasn't there anymore . someone else had moved into the apartment , and he couldn't tell me where she was .
i want to speak with you , please .
get moving - -
what's he like ?
for how long ?
you know somebody around here ?
well , that's a relief . thank you .
if you're asking my opinion , no . i'd read it to greer over the phone . ask him if he had any objections .
good . so what do you think ?
they're dead in the water that morning . four hours later the captain's relieved of his command . and that evening they issue a general sos .
japanese are here in a big way . cheap labor . factory space . but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso . i ferry ' em back and forth . they think i'm john-fucking - wayne .

liza sutton is dead .
what would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano ?
yeah , yeah , the hell with that crap ! the world series is goin ' on right ' now an ' that's therapy also !

no , not everything ? the sun is still shinning . it's a beautiful day out . some things are ok . right ?
deep down , gut check . i'm growing fond of <u> you </u> and it's liberating to say so .

we'll just be a minute . get a little more sleep .
and you expect to find him in here ? go and ask claudia .
why ? you have a bowling date ?
my lady , when one has lived with prophecy for so long , the moment of revelation is a shock .
my point is that one again , you're getting it all wrong . that won't improve your reputation any , and it's not very flattering to me either . so , i'm going to give you a chance to write the truth .
father ...
how about mrs . ackerman ? we both hate her ! should she be the next victim ?
what ? - - i ...
... you're hurting me ...
pretty well .
three cheers for our champion .

i can't do it .
i can't reach her .
i've already got something worked out . be seeing you .
thank you , rose .

me ? no . don't want none either . such bastards , man .
it's about time .
pretty sure .
i don't know . it hurts , harry . some things , no matter what you do with them , they just hurt .
it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being .
he told me he was going to hell .
my department doesn't have any record of that , mrs . bickerman .
did you go hunting .
and what do you burn , apart from witches ?
hi , mike ?
you're gonna be seeing a lot of me . you're sure you don't mind ?

it's very becoming to you , mr . selectman .
ride with me . we need a haircut .
these are private - - these are for us .
yeah ?
oh , for christ's sake .
okay . okay . everyone knows patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks . from aviation , freeway construction . but the man has hobbies , too . he bankrolls b movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers . and try this on : he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer . all in all a powerful behind-the - scenes strange-o .
you're too demanding .
how the hell do you know ?
still clear ?
don't let me dis ... i'll just ...
scotland .
so who's the guy ?
would you have me spend my life all alone ?
right , ho-jon . see you later .
yeah , right outside the door !
and fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants .
it's ' pose to be cold .
what's your shpiel , santa ?
let's just say that in my years with this department i've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th street .
your royal highness . what a pleasure to see you here .
oh , big issues . liberty . rights . justice . kings died and kingdoms fell . i don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but i do miss the kings . when i was a little girl i was taken to the palace in vienna , to a garden party . i can still see the sunshine , the parasols , and the flashing uniforms of the young officers . i thought then i would marry a soldier . later , frederick would chide me about it . he was so serious . a doctor at the university . and in the government .
it's okay , my sweet .
well , i wanted to make sure she's the same girl i sent .
good question . you took the bait .
can't land ... you'd kill people ...
omar - -
i thought i'd give you a hand since i kept you open .
do you ... have any more packages to deliver ?
what am i supposed to do ?
no , no thanks . hey , don't -
say hello for me .
i had them in my pocket .
can i help you ? russ yelburton , deputy chief in the department .
claudia , claudia , will you never learn ? who will we get now to finish your dress ? a little practicality , cherie ...
she jumped . she'd been depressed .
i work graveyard , swing and day all by my lonesome .
with us .
it's a safety room . if anyone breaks into your house , you can hide .
this is a highly irregular procedure ! this is absolutely unprecedented !
that is miss sherwood now . marge sherwood .
i'll bear that in mind .
cigarette ?
and flash isn't ?
so that's why you've turned to smuggling , eh ? you need the money . now , i can help you . i can see that you get some assistance from the government . but first there's a little formality we've got to take care of . just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch ... your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times ...
why ?
i think so . what'd he ever do to you anyway ?
why you think is today ?
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention .
in the morning , darlin ' , in the morning , we are g-o-n-e and you are f-r-e-e . now , i know i put you guys through hell , and i know i've been one rough pecker , but from here on end you guys are in my cool book . scotty , help me pick richie up , and lay him down . jacob , keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says , " digayo . " when you get to digayo , turn this big bastard left , go on down for a few miles , then you see a bar called " the titty twister . " from what i hear , you can't miss it .
give me a reason not to .
no matter what happens ... i'm glad i met you .
what ' re you talking about ?
and i planned getting you off the hangman's deck - -
me ?
well , it ruins it for me if you have grass because , you know , i'm , like , a comedian -
before you ? whoo-hoo !
who is it ?
one hundred kilometers ...
well , they offered you the carrot , and you turned it down ... you know what's coming next , don't you , boss ?

all you have to do is stop talking and just listen .
i don't want to hurt you .
<u> perhaps </u> ... shall we <u> see </u> ... ?
<u> everything </u> had to happen <u> just </u> right . for your little story to fly . i mean , a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u> lot </u> of reasons .
you know i am .
so , what ? eleven ?
bear with me here ...
oh , knights of ni , here is your shrubbery . may we go now ?
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river ? ?
where are you going ?
what is it you want from me ? some plantation follies ? some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch ? some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads ? you want me to go back to the ante bellum days ?
i don't know . just promise me one thing .
it's nothing . it's just a picture .
it doesn't matter . it'll work out .
yeah , i been waiting three years .
i said it's not worth the fight . steward , please .

hiss was protecting his wife . i've always believed that .

you don't have to make any decisions tonight .
i don't see anything , do you ?
lighten up adam . show some character .
then what do you want ?
yeah , i peed in the fountain there once . give me a break .

i mean , do you realize what you've ... well , of course you realize , that's why you're confessing , i mean ... i mean ... how could you do that ?
i been here a couple years .
those two guys were cops .

i don't need to talk to you .
what is going on ?
and have you something to settle with me ?
commodus - - listen to narcissus , listen to the man who has never lost a battle for rome ! you're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple !
jeez , mom , stop trippin ' .
it is a piece of paper with the letter " t " imprinted on it . take a look .
he should be king !
he's so dreamy . he's like ... a greek god . he's the cutest guy here . he's boss . he's fab . he's ...
a little . does it matter ? after all , whats the point of living if you cant feel alive ? isnt that right , elektra ? isnt that your motto ?
what does that mean ?
the man has friends . and they're not likely to forgive me if i testify against him .
yes - - oh - - oh - - yes , - -
either you go to sleep or i'll come in there and put you out .
they need help . jaime , anselma - - esta es mi jefa - -
the world is teeming with women - - ours to enjoy .
baby , you take yourself out of the game . you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream , of course it's gonna be on the friend tip .
you better hurry . he's engaged the override , we can't open the inner door .
i'm telling you you're messing up the story , now get it right !
got it , teach .
of course it's true - and he knows it .
do i get to see it or not ?
no .
yes .
i have expectations , too .
make us a nice cup of tea and i'll tell you . i might even let you watch .
sure .
telephone . i suppose you don't know the phone company killed kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up - - and they'll never let that happen . they control everything : what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end , and - -
we got no choice .
well , it won't work . love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet .
don't worry , he's with carter .
fasten yourselves in . there should be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again .
you jerk - -
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital ?
where's home ?
why should i ? you need practice . i can teach you to fight with the green destiny , but first you must learn to hold it in stillness .
i know and i thought i could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else , it's a dangerous mix .
don't be embarrassed , bruce . i heard it , but i just wanted to hear it again . i can stand being spoiled a little . the gentleman i'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling .
yeah ... you were a lot of help with those guns . your soldier shit is bad - ass .
really ?
must be my wife .
well , hell , the smoke's gonna kill us anyway !
that was my plan ... to be hardly recognizable to you as me .
huh ... the restaurant's just around the corner here ...
wait .
forget ricky . you should be glad max got you driving for me .
most vividly . " st . louis blues , " " potato head blues , " " sleepy time down south ... " ... then pops laid some " cornet chop suey " on me , and left me in the dust like a whipped dog .
that's what i said--the * truth * !
and we'd eat spaghetti-o's in bed from the can .
and sometimes you think you don't ? ! well , get away then !
fi ' cents ! they pain ' you fi ' cents ?
oh , mr szpilman , you're quite ... quite wonderful .
don't hurt him ...
why don't you assign one of your own men to this ?
sure .
he gets one day of confession each year . today is the day .
if you reach for that gun , i'm going to kill you .
why ?
i knew that feuds still went on , but i didn't think people like you and the general would be involved .
perseverance .
i know him . that's creek johnson .
what is it ?
i don't hear him moving around anymore .
it's hormonal , nathan . i can't help it . i'm sorry .
no , i don't .
the case is closed . harry . tapert's given us a full confession . get your ass back to mew york .
candy-stripe a cancer ward . it's not my problem .
no .
so , let's discuss how we're gonna do this ... thing .
they will hold lyssa in the center of the vortex , the place of the beast , where its power is greatest . no man can match it there . lyssa must try to move toward us . for as we enter the vortex and move closer ...
not in front of the kid .
sitting next to you .

and of course i accept . i'm flattered . and i want you to know , i work for only one president at a time .
yeah ... are we going to do it or what ? i still haven't packed .
this is it - - 3b . check it out .
they've broken their pattern .
yes sir .
i'll let you in on a little secret , roy . in two days this entire city will belong to me , and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it . it's the perfect time to switch teams ... so what do you say ?
i can't tell you how distraught i was . all night long . what the hell happened ?
a momentary lapse of judgment , soon to be rectified .
i'm not a theater checker . i'm a call girl .
we toil and labor , we loot and pillage , rape and kill ... and yet ...
and ? no . i don't wanna know . what do you <u> mean </u> " and ... " ?
we've done all our talking , wade .
is it , jerry ? you ask those three pour souls up in brainerd if a deal's a deal ! go ahead , ask ' em !
officers , i've never said the p-word out loud , much less written it down !
it'll still exit if they go on not knowing , won't it ?
yes .
go on , fool ; the marble shooters are waiting for you .
mommy ... ?
gettin ' a little hot under the collar , i'd say .
but how did you get here ? what are you doing here ?
must i hear this ?
the thing that started all of this .
they're yours . but how are you going to finish it ? without a star there's no movie .
not so perfectly if you noticed .
i suppose that's true in a way . i am fond of you , walter . i often wish you weren't such a stinker .
you know that's not what i meant ! look , i'm gonna put my foot down ! no more playing alone . you wanna perform , you gotta have an audience !
same as magruder , i don't like it when they turn out to be human .
hey ! on behalf of burnfield , i present to you the keys to the city .
yes , i am .
during the florida primary , you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child . you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls .
okay , jeremy ... go get dr . chris raymond , will you ?
i never - -
yeah ? so you up for a game later ?
but - - but - -
what are you doing ?
in the abstract ...
i've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man .
i don't know . but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was , and where i lived and ...
why do you think ?
what happened to them ?
yeah . i understand . just business . right . fuck you .
please do . he's a lonely guy .
i'm trying , goddammit - -
it's taken care of . the less you know about it the better .
a couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together . thank you , jeff .
good . she's a good girl . aren't you ? yeah , she's a lovely girl . and you know the queen's riding tomorrow ?
he was there and then he wasn't !
not quite . this is my field .
do you think alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator ?
... if this ...  ... weren't here ... ?
no , sir .
adultery isn't illegal - - it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or - - linda . linda . calm down .
umm-hmmmm .
she's right in the neighborhood . she's upset .
let's just see how we do .
because marrying that fool king westley is
no , really . i'm okay .
if you're gonna give me a hard time , wait outside .
let me think about it . hold it a day for me ?
i don't know . i don't understand dickie , marge , so your guess is as good as mine .
i figured that out .
wait ... what the hell is this ...
good evening , vincent .
now , is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car ?
umm , he got dark brownish eyes , he got a nice nose i love his nose . i love his skin . i love his lips , he got a great smile and he got -
no one else knows
tybalt , the kinsman of old capulet , hath sent a letter to his father's house .
no . thank you . it's really beautiful .
yeah . all over .
well , all right .
oh fuck .
beginning of what ?
yeah . so don't walk near me in public , alright .
andersonville . they did horrible things to men there ...
saw you in the street outside . you seemed interesting . is this where you live ?
you haven't been drinking , have you ?
vada , what's wrong sweetheart ?
i don't like the song .
i am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me , is this some kind of - -
he always had a weakness in that area . i saw it the first time i met him . we all had our weaknesses , i guess . daitz wanted the money . with dave it was the glory . koessler saw the behavioral sciences unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things . he had his eye on the director's job , even then . catching killers was a means to an end for them .
what do the years matter ? i've known you for centuries ...
h'm ?
yes , of god .
i can look and see .
oh !
how do you like it ?
don't worry . i'll talk to him .
this one could save your life .
really ?
the stripper's here .
oh , that's fun .
three .
which part of the room is mine ?
was i ? i wasn't a tad stiff ?
your mother thought he was a good man . he worked very hard . what i remember most was his manner was so ... slight . it was easy to spend time in a room , and not realize he'd been there the whole time .
i don't believe he did it .
no you're not . jack lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he's got the ambition . you haven't got the ambition but luckily you've got me . and mr helpmann . mr helpmann was very close -
why is it here ? barry ... barry ?
great !
go on , zack ! go for the record !
what do you need that for , dude ?
don't i know you ?
there is no alternative .
yeah . he finished awhile ago .
where we going ?
that's luke . he doesn't like strangers .
nope . i've never robbed a bank .
oh , you ... you're very popular , i can see .
do that again .
haven't you seen the cabana boy ?
whatta ya know . bayside , born and raised .
like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles . people only get the paper of coffee this time of morning .
it seems human . to me .
wolf-slayer , worm-sticker ... give a cheer for the champion !
explain to me how you could think that i shouldn't know about this . explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me . as a parent .
miles .
alex !
paul ... paul ... we'll have plenty of time to get into all this later . a whole year , in fact . right now i just need to finish my pie and get home .
hey , hey , seven-twenty . seven-twenty .
hey , be fuckin ' nice . calm . be nice . don't fuck up in here .
i imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point .
oh my ! oh my ... maybe you better come out now , miss starling .
he said he was following up some lead .
are you expensive ?
how nice .
we know so little about each other - -
try speaking to me ?
damn it . i was in the veteran's out - patient program . he knows me .
two hundred quid , mr . deveroux .
you could get your wish at any moment .
this is crazy . no one's ever gonna believe we're a real band .
i apologize , i just don't want to lose the light , we've got time for a quick scout , you've had work done .
is that what changed your mind ? the money ?
i did alright .
am i talkin ' raghead ? ! i want your car ! <u> gimme the goddamned keys </u> !
i swear to god .
i want to hear the truth .
basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i don't think it'll be too hard to - -
do you know what " normal " is ?
huh ?
they cut the power .
yes .
i've some wonderful news for you , leon . it's about punchy ... do you mind if i sit down ?
what'd i do ?
i'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here .
what do you get out of it ?
tell me .
so far , you have four and i only have two !
i'm captain john harriman . i'd like to welcome you all aboard .
what ?
i see .
don't be giving me attitude , lee . i've been here three days and we haven't done shit . we haven't been to a club , haven't even talked to a girl . i'm on vacation , and i want some mu-shu .
t-t-thanks alice ...
to check up on me ?
will you be joining us , soon ?
where am i ? and how can i leave ?
did you carry a gun ?
you really had me going , claire . i was finally ready to propose to you .
you're out of your skull - -
i was scared .
i didn't have a chance to thank you .
he should be caring . that is not too much to ask .
why else would he be taking you to the ivy ? you've been dating for a year - - it's not like he's trying to impress you .
julie , i'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth . i've seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .
don't start , alright .
that's deleon and hayes ' collar .
why later ?
this the only spare ?
i promise i'll make more time for jasper .
yes , it is a calamity for us all .
really ?
we'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them .
i know , mother .
a little better .
you're walking to california ?
where ?
who ?
tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid .
pardon the delay , folks , but we had to get mad bob younger under control !
it's a rule . always stand by your first count . the odds are you're right .
... central ... intelligence ... agency ...
see this ? coral . geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick .
no .
the elevators are still runnin ' .
you know , fred , they sell tickets .
yeah ... sid ?
but ... but you said you only had sex with three guys ! you never mentioned him !
you figured that all out yourself , huh ?
yes . yes .
let me check the zip - 212 fuck you ?
all right , what if the defendant <u> heard </u> ? so carl <u> let </u> him aboard , to help . and <u> then </u> the fishing gaff ?
ben , i'm afraid i've got to ask - -
no ? say , listeni've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat . toughest job i ever tackled . ever hear of j . p . clarkson ? biggest man in the country , isn't he ? well , i tamed him . got him eating out of the palm of my hand . i've browbeaten financiers , statesmen , foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut i've never been able to do a thing with her . she's been too much for me . i'm glad you think it's easy . now listenif you'll do what i tell you , perhaps i might develop a little respect for you . you never can tell .
aye .
he was accused of jury tampering .
roach , what are you doing ?
what's the matter with him ?
not now ... i don't want to think about it - -
forget it , really . i'll survive .
nothing , rose .
you try calling the police ?
now i have a plan about rose , an educational plan . she's getting better and we don't want any more trouble - - brother , you ought to hear this .
i remember , too , actually . i was frightened then . i am frightened now .
' yes ' is the answer to your question .
we made a mistake . let's not make it worse .
did you have so little interest in seeing me ?
famished .
i'm honored , honeythorn gump ... but no more tricks .
i'm used to it . not everyone likes music .
memento pink revisions - 9/7 / 99 85 .
i am not involved . keep clicking your little wires . you'll get someone else . good luck .
all right everybody , hold up !
madeleine's not wicked . it's the marquis who's corrupted her . that's not her fault ; it's mine .
trust is something you earn , over time . you don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire .
besides , if i lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which i do not--i wouldn't need a partner , much less a callow girl . i'd do it myself .
- - no , it'll help me , really - -
... we wouldn't have had our little accident .
then we should have had lunch at the bank .
i don't have a ring !
who ?
absolutely not .
he has a big mouth . yes ! it seems to me i did read something about that incident as a student . but you have to remember that a worm - - with very few exceptions - - is not a human being .
sebastian , i'm not an alarmist .
you see ? never tells me nothin ' . ace , what do we got on for next week ?
it isn't fair . i'll give you one of my favorite cats ... a jellicle cat . " jellicle cats have cheerful faces , jellicle cats have bright black eyes ; they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise . "
yeah , ya kinda remind me of the rock . ya move like ' im .
i ain't heard of nothin ' .
what the hell is the tampon test ?
ripped off . by hand , my guess . perimortal : victim was alive at the time , there's blood on his throat .
ah ! well then , they're going to have to pay for that , aren't they ?
when you're frozen , you're legally dead , right ?
well , even without anesthesia i always tell my patients to ... eh ... to relax .
i'm holding you to that . gabe , what about frank ?
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?
it gets , um ... it gets so lonely sometime .
i guess it proves you really care about me . you hung in there .
surprise , luther .
are you hit ?
but from now on , any leads on this case go to pluchinsky . he's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the bomb squad ... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more . got it ?
maybe they went out for the evening . let's leave them a message and head home .
i'll prove it !
john . just tell me , who's leo crow ?
i lied . the journey will be longer than i said .
horses with horns ! huh ! do we have ' em in nevada ?
er . well , nowhere special .
all right , i'll tell them . they're right here in front .
i've always wanted to play carnegie hall .
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect .
louella ... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch ?
no , sir !
oh . mixed up in that revolution ?
now listen , this is the plan . as soon as school is finished we go to utah and ...
what about him ?
it is . go on , mr . thatcher -
hope you find him . i love that dog .
what time do they expect us ?
baby , i'm sorry . i feel terrible . i'd stay and talk but i'm so late . look , don't be upset . we'll talk when i get home . see you around midnight . bye . and don't brood . watch t . v . or something .
sort of .
you don't know that's true . but kay , just for the sake of an argument , let's assume it is , i'm not saying it is , remember , but ... what if i gave you what might be some justification for what he did ... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did .
let's go back , barry ...
there's just one more thing .
i'm still not confident we can ride through this . some people are going to have to go to jail . hunt's not the only problem . haldeman let me use the $ 350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments . ehrlichman had a role , a big role , in the ellsberg break-in . and i'm ... uh , i think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses .
you'll be safe here . he won't kill in a church .
oh , yeah ? terrific .
yeah but oh man , wouldn't you just love to get one of those gibsons , baby ? ooooh !
yes , i'm afraid i have .
why ?
whoa , cool your maples . over the bridge , past the peter pan , last house on the dead end . theo releases sid's hand . sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand .
yes , sir .
she can spread her wings , right here in pennsylvania . you don't send a child alone to los angeles , she could come back with her ears pierced , her legs shaved and god knows what else .
yeah , maybe it'll be okay . at least i'll get to see every movie for free , i guess ... i had to lie and tell them i already graduated ...
hm ? oh , yes .
i'm going to wait in the car .
opinion , mister . spock ?
that's okay , hannah . it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies . sex - you can learn from movies . but robberies ? there's no way .
yes . the scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for .
who put up my bond ? ordell ?
it wasn't easy .
hey , relax guy !
that's a crock ! if one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up .
i'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far ...
morning after ?
looking for someone .
more than prince of cats . he is the courageous captain of compliments . he fights as you sing prick - song , keeps time , distance , and proportion ; he rests his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button , a duellist , a duellist ; a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause : the immortal passado ! punto reverso ! the hai !
doolittle , hello ?
knows nothing of a grave out at mission dolores , or an old house an eddy street , or a portrait at the palace of the legion of honor ?
morlocks - -
' is this all i am ? is there not more ? '
talk not to me , for ill not speak a word . do as thou wilt for i have done with thee .
it's not really working out for me here , dad . i was thinking ... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home .
now we had a deal here ! a deal's a deal !
you're totally full of shit , aren't you ?
oh honey , it's so much better when we do it without the helmet .
a bargain buy , from china . ten cents each , i'll get a dollar .
... you know that car ?
me ! ? why would anyone want to kill me ? !
man named turk baker ?
but we haven't run out of history just yet . your father quoted hamlet : he called the future - " the undiscovered country " ...
after this sort of thing , how do people manage to look at a car , let alone drive one ? i'm trying to find charles's car .
its ' ... ah ... about my daughter ...
did he say anything about me - tell me ?
where are the guards ?
someone with authority i'd imagine , wouldn't you ? don't you know what you're onto ? come on .
no way phil . not like this .
one we're producing .
let's be democratic .
' bout two hours left .
did i hurt you ?
no no . i'm a psychologist , but i do research . i'm a behaviorist . i work with animals . mice at the moment .
please .
he's a softy . got him wrapped around my finger .
what the hell you doin ' back there ?
you just did an incredibly brave thing ! what you should have done was land your plane . you don't own that plane , the taxpayers do . i should ream you out for it . but it just doesn't work with you . you're a hell of a flyer . you are maybe ... too good . you never really stepped in it yet . so this is your chance . i'm gonna send you up against the best . they are better than you . maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see , finally , where discipline and teamwork fit it . maverick hasn't really heard anything but topgun . he snaps out of it .
the premiere . i never pressed you about it but god damn it , you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were !
there's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage . that's what ransom is . those are the fucking rules .
if you say so .
... it's very bizarre - i don't know what to think ...
what if captain dawson had come with me ?
reverend dyer , this is kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor ...
yes , it does . the sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .
energy shielding positive function .
well .
yes ...
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it . maybe the trouble isn't with the joke . maybe it's with you !
no . i think it's fucked .
you want her to call you jack ?
put out a p . b . s ... or whatever it's called .
i thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash ?
not dead ? in a cemetery ?
steph .
it's not what i heard .
yeah ?
out here , you always fight for survival . you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance . slowly , your gang becomes your family . all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier .
i will also speak with the king , for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to mademoiselle beaufort has caused .
- - and keep your eyes on the road .
let's talk about that . i'm looking for some men .
i've got a present for you ...
told what ?
we've met . the hacksaw murders . ' 89 .
why not ?
what is it ?
but my parasite is consuming all the new memories . eating my lines .
what for ?
enjoying our hospitality ?
you heard her - yes .
you know , most movies that win a lot of oscars , i can't stand . " sophie's choice " , " ordinary people " , " kramer vs . kramer " , " gandhi " . all that stuff is safe , geriatric , coffee-table dog shit .
i love you .
so the guy's not a sicko .
what ?
i suppose you gotta get up early , huh ?
if he runs , everyone will assume he took the money .
gear shift .
start singing .
this mercedes of yours , what's it look like ?

northeast sir !
jean , it's ... it's not so easy ...
someone'd have to go to the switchroom , pull the coupling lever , that'll send us left and to the elevator .
<u> comwatch dispatch system </u> . can't assimilate voice stress . code priority only .
everybody has a weakness .
no shit .
oh , angela ! go with these trappers ! they'll lead you safely down the mountain ...
two years ! two years later and out of your paycheck , i never charge interest - -
yeah seems okay .
capture god ! in order to retrieve v'ger's data , the creator has to physically come here ! ...
that's fucking great , barry . we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each . fantastic , barry !

i don't care .
we're going to get you a bodyguard , don't worry . ed , i have some news for you . we're picking up ed tv for another month !
i had no idea you'd be this good !
you live around here ?
do you know that house ?
about sex ?
this must be beast .
the first one was fine .
no problem .
hell yeah .
what gentleman , maria ?
jack . we've all seen it . he's probably a hundred and fifty years old , he's bigger than an elephant .
all right . ' cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships , shots being fired across bows ...
why'd we have to leave so fast ?
they may . that's why i would keep my mouth shut .
you and your husband never discussed her ?
you're the tribune man ?
nowhere ...

yeah , french guys from france .

he's a big one .
daddy ?
don't cry .

i like to see her happy .
don't worry about that . hey , fellas , this here is my mama . these are some of my friends . that's willie , there's poker face , radio , cookie , goldmouth , biscuit , jangle leg .
what's wrong , nathan ?
when ?
that would be mrs de moraes mother , sir . mr and mrs spitz are here with their daughter .
it's a sign i've watched this movie too many times . i'm so stupid . from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio , i've been a complete jerk .
which side of the road ?
thanks again . i ' m glad you waited .
yes , comrade .
allah has sent us a prophet , a black man named elijah muhammad . for if god is black , malcolm - -
no , just leave it . he knows i must be at home . i'm working nights this week .

the threat of nuc 1ear terrorism has been quelled . we are in <u> contaot </u> with the albanian premier , who assures me , and this government <u> credits </u> his assurances , that his country does not wish us ill , and <u> has </u> not . that the threat which we perceived was not of his wish , or of his making .

i'm not going to rob you , mister . do i look like a thief ?
i wanted to .
would you like a piece of cake ?
" all at once am i--several stories high - - knowing i'm--on the street - - where you live . " it's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves .
leave me alone !

i find it convenient to keep my interests ... mobile . anyway , i've had my fill of life on the ground . after spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer - - after outliving three wives and two children ... i find i've had quite enough of planet earth .
you've got lipstick all over you .
fixing it ? but i fixed - - where'd you get all that ?
what do you expect me to do about it ?
i did not , grandma .

i'm not sure .
henceforth you shall be ... little wilbur .

you are passionate , mozart ! but you do not persuade .
fuck you .
you know , his senses start tingling ... when he was approaching danger and shit .
you can stay in my room .
i'm cold .

what about thursdays and fridays ?
sure .
oh yeah ?
you asked to see me , ma'am ?
well , it seemed to me - -
what the fuck are you doing ?
it isn't safe for you to remain in this area .
i - -
someone worthy of respect , lad . she be a water spirit , lives in a bog down at sea-side . hideous creature to look at , even by my doubtful standards ; devours little children , she does , when she can catch them .
what ?
but how could you say such a thing ?
yes .
and you didn't send her to a doctor .
vegas !
wait a minute . my birthright is in the graveyard ? later not .
one year ... almost one year .
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
it's me . can you hear me ?
upset words .
we're american soldiers . we don't abandon people .
i'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections - -
you won .
that'll help you out fine . that's the best way for you , not for me ! i swear to god , i'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this . you understand ? i don't care what happens , he doesn't find out .
what ? what did we do ?
that's a much easier game .
muy bien !
but why ? there must be some way to make her understand !
that the universe will unfold as it should .
how did he look ?
yeah , i can't believe liberace was gay . women loved him , man . i didn't see that one coming .
your name is conor ?
the umbrella .
... hi ...
something i got to ask you , marty . i've been very very careful . have you been very very careful ?
up down . down up . it's the same . you see things through both eyes .
now hold on , pete , we gotta speak with one voice here - careful with that fire now , boys !
i'm not regan .
feur , i think . psych department . figures . they're all psychotic .
yes . later .
bible truth .
you got to be more careful . hands is important . let me show you something . when i was a kid , now i don't know if you can still see it , but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower .
why don't i just get your phone number , that's usually how it works .
it's what you want ?
rod - -
i'm not holding my breath in that department .
could you slow down a little ? or we could wait for the car ...
the woman you're stuck on .
okay . yeah . what time ?
sure it is . i think tonight brady was ready to make a commitment . but now my future relationship , my engagement , my marriage , my children , your grandchildren , have all been wiped out because i have to baby sit tonight .
when may i expect the cleaners ?
don't play innocent with me , thelma . you know perfectly well what's going on .
the number's seventy-five . and it's applications and patents .
oh , hi . i'm fine , sara . my god , a voice from the past !
yes . the five men . they were , of course , your husband , charles , the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday , and carson dyle . but something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact . it must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money .
how it's going ? it's going like a first date in prison , whattaya think ? !
don't run off , jude .
my god ...  ... how is that possible ? you have to help me , doctor yolander . i don't know what i'm dealing with here ! they've dug up my wife ...
i wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble , lynda .
you don't have a passport .
marge , you like everybody .
oh , your excellency , i don't know what to say .
oh , yes , the bonus .
you fucked us over .
it's me .
early , what're you doin ' ?
i'm fine with it , or i wouldn't of done it , i did it to feel better about myself , and i do . when i look in the mirror it looks like me .
brilliant , admiral .
every time i start thinking like that i get the clap .
uh huh . right here in river city .
this is . go home . stay out of this .
yes . but i got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
i wasn't used to being big - - wasn't used to thinking in big ways . now , i've made up my mind .
i'm leaving . goodbye !
maybe i do .
okay , okay . i'll call the girl .
i don't buy that .
yeah , i guess you do .
i have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry .
we're on our way . alan-one gave me the coding we need to go up against master
what if i were to say " you're fired ? "
i don't think you know what you are .
let me have it . " aboard the s . s . manchuria . last night conway seemed to recover his memory . kept talking about shangri - la , telling a fantastic story about a place in tibet . insisted upon returning there at once . locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at singapore . am leaving ship myself to overtake him , as fearful of his condition . wrote down details of conway's story about shangri-la which i am forwarding . lord gainsford . "
i don't want you to think that i'm that way to you - - i'm not gonna call you a slut or something - -
in the winnebago .
no matter how it happened , if she goes ahead and has it " zack , there'll be a child in the world that's mine - - and i couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived .
what is it ? how does it work ?
what do they look like ? ...
alright , alright .
i know . i tried that .
well , this is it . we get the car , find some americans . we find americans we'll be all right .
out-of-town . that's all he'll say .
what ?
if it works out and all , maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to . see you later .
you're driving around north beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way - -
i don't understand .
she does have one thing you don't .
how long have you been here ?
oh for chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of - -
you should ... mind it .
- - how ? - -
yes ?
better unlock the door . sit up , darling , and be dignified .
okay .
pops , when you're right , you're right , and you are right .
hello .
i mean , what are you going to do about billy ?
got a job for you .
ask monsieur rick .
but don't you <u> do </u> anything . you just have a seat , wait for me to get there .
you'll answer my questions ?
all this blood is scaring the shit outta me . i'm gonna die , i know it .
i didn't ask for your advice .
it's over , elliot . i don't know how to make it any clearer . it's over . i can't see you anymore .
we don't know . and that's the point . maybe there's a mole . whatever , it's a disaster . and it's a joint interagency task force . i have dea , atf , u . s . customs components in on it . so the penetration could be from any one agency . what we do know is i have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions ' cause i have to assume our operational security is blown .
thank you , melvin . you overwhelm me .
yeah .
i'll get a job tomorrow , i promise . if i don't , you can totally tell me to fuck off .
yes , but we must also show them that we still exist .
that's easy . antiseptics .
tell her , what the hell , close early today , live dangerously .
don't you work here ?
the amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states .
hawk .
they said that's not such a good idea , the shock alone could - -
you have to excuse me , mr . boone . since my stroke , i am often overcome with nostalgia .
buff ...
but i like that one , scottie .
what are you bitching about now ?
good-bye , darling . i'll only be gone until three .
about those colorful metaphors we discussed . i don't think you should try to use them .
did you do it ?
yeah . right .
all the more reason i should be here .
uh ... sure , tawny ... what ?
who is he , his name ?
could you believe mr . blonde ?
what about the sender ?
i'll take the camels .
but y'see , chum , the problem i got is that one country just won't play ball with me . you know how that can just bug a guy , don't you ?
so ?
because ... i know .
two million dollars ?
my suitcase was vibrating ?
and you called your friend , and she's telling you not to go ? when i went to europe my friends told me i was crazy .
did it really go well ?
good . except for pms .
and he invented fire .
it'll just be a few days .
it's a man's world , mr . booker . most women have to .
one beer with lunch is hardly " drinking " .
well , i'll tell her i ran into you .
mother and - - ? you knew your mother and father ?
almost five !
i take it you don't like miss lawson very much ?
so she told me . i'm a teacher - - not a practitioner .
only five , sir . we've checked them all . he hasn't used any of them .
i've got to go - -
i'll be around .
i've always wanted to make love to an angry welder . i've dreamed of nothing else since i was a small boy .
i never left the garage without my windex .
without calling me ?
it came up during the meeting .
well , i'd say who i was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink .
perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth .
oh , you were there ?
brad kovitsky .
sins of the flesh ? everybody has those .
i don't know ... they're pretty quick ... fifteen seconds ?
and he was missing an arm .
why ?
i hope so . wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this - - with my cold and everything - - how do i look ?
the key to success is using the right tools .
the control board's glitched . you know we can't carry a live picture .
i like that one .
that she's going to marry somebody else .
well , we want good stuff .
wake up .
i tell you one thing , we're not gonna be towing no ship now .
are you nuts ! it's too risky !
if i go out the back , he'll know you've warned me .
oh ... i'm sorry . was i singing again ?
i was in new hampshire . i was at the old location .
drop me off ? how do you mean ?
did phyllis in accounting tell you to call me ?
tot ice skating ? tots can't ice skate . liberty bell's still getting the hang of stairs .
i'll call us in . dodge , see how many signal flares you can scrounge up . keep an eye on him .
i love red ! that's my favorite color !
hey , i'm not just along for the ride , so i don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut .
rowan ...
and , miss mitchelli think from now on you'd better work directly with me .
no , no , don't go in there .
it's so cruel .
these people are professionals . they don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt .
yes , i am - - i'm compulsive about it - - dishonesty infuriates me . like when you go into a drugstore .
yeah , i had my first taste on that trip to juarez . at that age you still got a lot of energy .
" it's a perfect day for a monster jump . " hey man , can you like do me a favor ?
that's right . i'm not like you . i'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong ... there's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and i'm gonna get him . because it's my job . and if you don't get that ...
well ... um ... her .
what if i told frank that you opened me ?
two lumps , madame ?
sure .
i think it's the food of the future .
i want to - - what else can i do with my money ? you may not see me again - - for a while .
oh , i could kill him ! i mean really kill him . i actually threw the entire opera on the fire , he made me so angry !
it's your best play , nicky .
caesar's mafia , isn't he ?
what month ?
i'll come down .
no !
you are too ! mooning over julie when we could <u> both </u> be gettin ' some o ' this fine local action . it's not like she's gonna know . out of town , under five minutes , and in a coma don't <u> count </u> .
i'm sorry , mr . daglish , this is the mille collines . no working girls here .
you're startled ?
plus what i owe you ?
and that's one !
jesus christ ... the goddamn english will pay for this !
my father had this friend ... he was an inventor ...
<u> negative </u> , golitsyns on the move .
they must've hit something .
yes .
for a while there , you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man . then one day he keeps looking at his watch , and asks you if there's any lipstick showing , then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to white plains . so you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee - - and you sit there by yourself - - and you think - - and it all begins to look so ugly - -
i hope she gets better .
can you check again ?
no it's mom .
if the ship goes , so does jaso .
any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers ?
we need to talk - -
they're all dead ... dead , i tell you . ahhhh , we're all deaaaddddd . tyrellll , joinnnn usss .
oh , what , in this section of town ?
you live and learn . i realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .
you tossed my hat out the window .
are they all as - - small - - as that ?
thanks , but i think i'm gonna stick to my mom , she led a fascinating life too .
excuse me ?
how do ya think i got it , for chrissake ? hey , put that thing down . this is my goddamn apartment , you can't just ...
what ?
i agree .
i don't think it was them .
it happens all the time .
well , get me and chris a drink then .
you're marvelous , ma . you're just like father used to be . do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves ?
shush . janet's probably asleep by now . do you want her to see you like this ?
moving along quite well .
who's this fat man , then ?
what is it ?
make it the way i always do .
put her on .
dan , are you really that paranoid ? let's face it , eddie blake was no mother teresa .
no .
it's the only way .
these two holes are yours ...
you know that guy in the pictures you saw ?
you want to take a walk with me ?
i'm always all business .
be that as it may . u is for unconditional election . god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved , the elect , and he has chosen them from the beginning of time . l is for limited atonement . only a limited number will be atoned , will go to heaven .
yeah , the best .
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for ? shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie ?
better take ' em to virgil's downtown . we got a dead body in there .
i have no idea - i just want to ...
okay .
you wanna go on a date with me ?
me too .
i was wrong .

i've got a real feeling that this is the fellow .
the case that i am <u> working </u> on ...
what is it ?
how's the stock market ?
the whole city's together on this one . we took a vote . everybody's down on you , you know .
didn't evelyn waugh say that the country under atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation ?
how does it matter who's sister ? the main thing , they're through and -
the point of what ?
a satellite dish ?

well , i'm a puppeteer ...
gee - - that fair - -
i want to come in , and see if everybody's okay .
" god is great , " yes ?
not exactly . but it's his kind of neighborhood .
oh , wow .
what ?
that's not bad .
i'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only . there's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense .
yes .
yeah , like i was a plate of leftovers - - somethin ' wrong with my face - - whatta i need , a caddy to connect with ya sister ?
i have a confession . when we met ...
could i have it , please .
so when you hear the smoking sign go ' ding ' , you know everything's going to be okay .
let's drop it .
didn't debbie deserve anymore ?
bomb #20 to sergeant pinback . roger , i read you , continue .
i can't believe i'm doing this .
violet ?
we've been chasing this deal six months , and now you're gonna chuck it out the window ?
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours . he's my pharmacist .
- - but they got it all wrong . any fool can figure it out . spider-man nailed this guy !
baby , you did fine .
you know what i mean ...
we've been over this a hundred times . it's too dangerous for him .
not yu . you !
he's dead .
hit the fuckers .
thank you , mothershead . have a porter put them in my office .
well , we'll have to take what's here . a bird in hand is worth two in jail .
the voice again .
yes , madame ?
not loving enough . that is a terrible thing to do to someone . i suppose i did it to clive . always held something back .
don't worry about that . you'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work .
okay - - perfect timing as ever - - hold the fort for a second will you , martin ?
catherine ...
we'll be okay . i want you to wait by the lifeboats , just in case .
i didn't ask anyone for a shrink , that was someone else . also : this pudding is not mine . also : i'm wearing a suit because i had a very important business meeting this morning and i don't have a crying problem .
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar .
well , what else do you expect them to call you ?
cecile , you had an orgasm .
how grand ?
whose then ? lindsey ? talk to me ...
some of it might come back to you .
can i use your bathroom first ?
buddy'll take care of him . keep him out've trouble . he's jack's conscience . always has been . he tell you how they met ?
sure . anyplace in particular ?
i'm concerned about her health .
.. oh , you could do nothing ! i can save you much pain .
unpack nothing . i didn't say i was staying .
sir elliot .
i've suggested it myself . but i hate to even think such a thing . she needs me ... and it isn't ...  ... it isn't as if she were a maniac , a raving thing ... it's just that ... sometimes she goes a little mad . we all go a little mad sometimes . haven't you ?
but it's impossible .
- - sig-sauer . 38 . i love it .
why no , sir . i don't believe so .
how do you gut someone ?
well , how about those old romantic movies with those great stars , huh ? like audrey hepburn .
that's great . it's a great color for you .
you have a blind grandfather . one day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people . i read about it . you're going to be famous . you're going to invent a lot of things .
what do you expect me to do about it ?
how the hell would you know ?
well , i never heard that one .
looks like you went quite a distance .
" see what's around you listen to their lies "
i don't think people even noticed . i thought the ceremony was perfect .
my baby !
hop in , marty , . we've got a long drive ahead of us .
you were a great scientist once . don't squander your genius on evil .
take my van !
yes , sir ?
you going away ?
if you have built castles in the air , your work need not be lost . that is where they should be . now put foundations under them .
beats forty hours on a plane .
i think maybe , we're both so used to operating at this level that - - how can one person be unhappy ? if one person is unhappy , both have to be ... by definition .
where's rob ?
that's the deal .
he's probably been waiting all night at the station .
mmm ... and to cut to the chase , forensically speaking - - is there a pre-nup ?
i'll get the boots .
please . i want you to . it would make me so happy .
piece of fucking cake .
been drinkin ' today ?
what did you find ?
there's terror everywhere . if you train yourself to look for it .
i won't lie .
of course . there's no need to shout .
hello , anna ahm ... scott - - have some wine .
will you wait until the chump is played ?
it's okay , babe . we're with you .
when we divorce a decade ago , she was very , very angry . now she's just hostile .
i've just been so busy , lisa .
i didn't hear you .
do you wanna wrestle ? it's a good way of breaking the ice . that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together .
why ?
evil ? do you believe in evil ?
$ 40 a day and expenses . expenses run pretty high on a case like this . i'm a long way from home . i don't have a b . c . licence . i'd need about $ 500 for a retainer .
what did you study ?
smashing !
it's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick . and porous .
coke ?
i wanna know first : to what do i owe this honor ? i mean , i never even heard of this guy .
with a <u> shotgun </u> ! she kills <u> both </u> of ' em , and ... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces . not one bill is left alive . i mean , what are the odds ?
i know you did - - i said you did - -
we work in the dark . we do what we can .
no ... !
people don't fly down in their own god damn plane for " just a meeting " - -
i've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years .
hey , i got some great stuff ... it's okay .
um ... look , there's something i've , uh , that's been bothering me for a long time , and i just thought i'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here , and that's this .
but you are aware , he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager .
... is it me ? is there something i've done ?
you're wife died . you can't feel responsible for that .
didn't i tell you to knock before you came in here ?
yeah . come oncome on !
oh no , i would have done that . but i would have made sure i killed them , too .
your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place , mrs de moraes . and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise . you dont mess around with child procurers . right now my guess is hes either on the run , held captive , or dead . i understand your misgivings , mrs de moraes . but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from . if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man . which leads me to why im here at such a late hour . i need 20,000 , in cash , by 11 this morning .
thanks for your help , lionel .
marry you ?
go away . let me rot ?
yeah . come on out , luke .
he is dead ?
it was probably luck - i'd rather you did the shooting .
just remember - you're a target . don't you think vince has a t . v . ?
what , lady disdain ? are you yet breathing ?
no no , not you .
excuse me .
no !
thanks .
she didn't work out , had to cut her loose .
mmm .
so you're courtin ' the preacher's girl . well , just watch your step , boy , or he'll preach you right into hell . i'm counting on you , reverend .
god isn't there to do it .
tell me where i can find her .
i found these . the others are still in storage .
you getting my checks ... ?
they ain't never seen a bull gang before .
do you have any idea what this means , simone ? our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it .
i had a minute before the mapp hearing - - but i couldn't get you on the phone , eddie ...
i'll keep that in mind .
stop what ? what are you - - ?
i thought we were goin ' to a movie .
i think you're right .
yes .
i can't let you do this ...
water fountain's through that door , down the hall .
the sunrise ? what for ?
has roger spoken yet ?

i was crossed-trained in gunships .
please . i'm sorry . i'll see it through . what do you want me to do ?
first she did her make-up . you know , i hate it when they do that . i mean she does the whole works , the mascara , the eye-shadow , the lipstick , the rouge ...
arthur ! who's arthur ?
he said that my hand felt good .
i begged him . don't see why he had to go ...
i think , you know , maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin ' . i don't know .
i don't care .
the why'd the police let him go ?
killin ' ' em's the hard part . gettin ' away with it's the easy part . whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed ? burn the midnight oil tryin ' to find who done it ? they couldn't give a flyin ' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin ' head . if you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin ' gun in your hand , you got away with it .
yeah . you know ... hang out .
what are they ?
and don't forget . i have the key .
destroy superman !
okay , you made your point . we'll just have to do it next wednesday - - that's the only night of the week i can get away .
i made a decision , because i have to consider the integrity of the scene . i can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field .
just a little ways . up to those trees .
no , owen .
if ye'd wanted a bloody cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody states !

yes . should i take her , louis ? among her dolls ? make a doll of her in turn ?
i'm playing to win .
bye . she looks a little like me when i was a little girl .
i don't know . i guess i like your stories .
hi , baby . i've missed you .
go to millie's hair salon in spitalfields . take her to the metro for a margarita . don't have to tell her who you are . just tell her jody was thinking - -
your girl works in there ...

ludwig ? he's gay - are you jealous ?
i understand woman , damn !
oh , jesus , they've stopped .
no pistol . ever .
now you must pay me .
you're shockingly honest , that's what makes you great . i've never had a man treat me this way . with you , i feel really ... listened to . can i tell you something ? it's a little embarrassing , but i feel very unguarded with you .
are you questioning my orders , major ?
she watches ... she listens .
keep it anyway . i have another one at home .
i need you to look at each one carefully ... very carefully . look for anything that seems strange or out of place . anything at all .
it won't . as long as i'm here .
they're playing games behind the couch ...
fortuitous even .
about how pretty you are , pretty boy . maybe he'd like to know - -
i am only his humble servant , but the maharajah usually listens to my advice .
georgia .

that's right , mister . you better be afraid . i told you it wasn't over , but you didn't listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
enough with the barbie n ' ken shit . i know .
no , no ... it's okay , mr . eddy .
i got your message . way to go !
i don't want to be responsible for his food . just a small green salad . and a perrier .

my patient had to leave early .
resting , he's had a long day . aramis - -
the sled as a shield ...
half a flounder . hmmm ... a burlap bag ... a paint can ... aha !
dogshit . worse yet , they don't care .
i'm not really asking you , i'm telling you .
- - turn around .
sit down , jack , i could weep . i really could . sometimes i think i'll retire . just piss off to the bahamas and let somebody else employ them , glenda , get jack a drink . what is it , jack ?
nick ...

what do you think mom would say ?
you like to have kids , you just don't want to be with them , do you ?
nay . this is a private affair , no audience welcome ... better you watch the dismantling of our enemies ... and , look you , see the moat is set aflame .
nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .
so sensitive .
yeah ? well obviously not always !
i was wounded before warsaw .
did you get it , too ?
alright , i'm . . . no way . . . is this a joke ?
wh-why's he ... why's he up there , mom ?
fascinating . do you use a bow or do you just pluck it ?
we also need a fucking money counter , william ! we have to get the money out by thursday and i'll be buggered if i am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer , couldn't you be a little more subtle ?
don't you think he trusts us together ?
don't ever trust them . they never tell the truth or honor their commitments . vietnamese are like russians . both are dogs .
kate reynolds ...
cut out that us business .
what <u> is </u> your problem ?
sure , why ?
he hasn't played it in a long time .
take'm back upstairs , but don't tie'm like before . that little fuck untied himself anyway .

you've had plenty of time already !
you'd better try to get some sleep , bob .
you'd try anything . i got first dibs . you get ya own stuff .
they're around ... they just don't care about us ' cause we're the contest winners . let's go find stoner boy ... make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or ping-pong paddles or something .

new orbit commencing ... coming up on sector three ...
i am not a wealthy woman .

maybe . listen . you wanna know why i chase women ? i find women charming .
yep , fifteen thousand btu's , enough to cool off this whole place .
how do you know ?
as long as i tell him beforehand he won't object . he'll be hurt , but he won't object .
jesus , man , you look terrific . you must have put on twenty pounds .
you must be out of your mind . i've been so happy these last few days - - now you've spoiled it all .
i'm not boffing matthew !
claire , claire , claire , if you're not dead , he's going to assume you're with me .
where to ?
never . i mean ... i don't really like ... singers .
is " he " inside ?
certainly .
but ... has anyone seen him in london ?
nice place you got here .
no , i have my things in the car .
i could have it all ! holy cats ! all the oil ! all the tankers ! all the pumps ! the gosh-darn world will be out to lunch ! no heat , no gas--sis , this is some nifty idea !
oh yes .

we're examined once a year . her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits .
wadda you wanna buy a shop for , will you tell me ? you gotta good job , you got no wife , you got no responsibilities . boy , i wish i was you , boy . waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop ? what's he want ? five thousand down ? you're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty , seventy bucks a month . a mortgage anna note from the bank . for pete's sake , you're a single man with no responsibilities . stay that way , boy . take my advice .
you've got to get me out of here ! six weeks - - sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors !
peter .

how bad off is he ?
let me think . the newport . harry's . fluties . endochine . nell's . comell club . the new york yacht club . the regular places .
oh . this is ... wed arranged to meet tonight and im due to return to paris tomorrow ...
is maybe ... the inside woman .
frank ? i'm frightened .
sherry ... i love you .
why bother with orsini-rosenberg ? he's obviously no friend of yours .
this guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks , ever since he got outta jail , wreaking general havoc , contributing to the bad name of the place . the term " menace to society " was made up for him .
this really isn't a good time .
so do i .
you signed out twice .
if you want to see me you will not do this . you will make an appointment ...
alright . she told him to meet us here . fuck .
is there a mrs . dyle ?
you fucking build it ! men come ...
you spend too much time - - much too much worrying about that crap ... oh good .
this peter's a motherfucker .
how ?
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says . so that's what they built .
is there a connection between them , alderman ?
... and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns , harrington , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then mr . stearns , he tried to fix a case .
one of you would end up dead .
is it , jerry ? you ask those three pour souls up in brainerd if a deal's a deal ! go ahead , ask ' em !
there's only one thing it could be ... short range scan .
how did they manage to do that without any communication ?
but i'm not prepared to die .
the key ?
thank you . thank you .
must be my clothes line . no ? how bout my phone line ?
yes ?
in mr . dyle's room ?
so ? that's logical . you see , both being gardeners , they spoke about you to one another .
i beg your pardon ?
be glad i made you what you are ! you'd be dead not if i hadn't .
well , uncle pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an ' if i ever wanted a partner for a killin ' , you was the worst one . meanin ' the best . on account of you're cold as snow an ' don't have no weak nerve nor fear .
deanna , stand by . open a channel .
she's not tied up !
whatever it is , it must be common on the tepui . john used it as packing material .
the killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue , doesnt want to see you take over ...
that's beside the point .
some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming ! american soldiers do not wait for good weather - - they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty ! an american soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy ! anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh , feel free to lay down and die , you get me ?
no ... right ... this is rape ... mark you , i'm not saying i couldn't get to like you ... in fact ... well , to be quite honest , i prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people ...
tired ?
dad !
just an idle question .
can i get you anything ... coffee ... tea ... a little tequilla ?
then don't .
i know . but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
no , it isn't that .
how did she know where it was ?
you can have half .
what do you want me to do about it ?
can you account for his disappearance in any way ?
why the fuck didn't you invite me ? i would've come .
you know damn well i nearly puke when i look at her . i don't even think she's a real blonde .
i'll throw this out . precautionary measure .
you , um , you , um , you going out with your fiance ?
they can't be serious . the ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard .
no , she was old and probably senile . maybe schizophrenic .
i shall remember to pay it ... to myself .
soggy bottom boys - i don't precisely recollect , uh -
i don't really like to drink .
i had a witness i would .
his name's not future man , dignan .
yes , i presumed it was about him .
harold , calm down ! this is ...
attitude ? me ? i think that <u> you </u> guys should be more enthusiastic . shit , we've been trying to get laid forever , and tonight's the night we've been waiting for . we're in this together . don't back out on me now !
meth precursors and the dutch party favors are en route .
this kind of heat . it's pathetic .
it's frogs . it's raining frogs .
let's hope you make the most of it , my boy .
i have attorneys . they have friends . i have friends . money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends .
and , ching chong , you're not a special needs kid . you're just a foreign exchange student .
no . he was wearing a mask ... but i saw the cut on his wrist . it was peter .
you didn't help .
cargo hold , everyone in the cargo hold . lesgo , lesgo , lesgo .
one word to i . a . and he walks .
but why ? just so you can show it all off - - just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are ? !
no ... not yet ...
i just meant - -
we need something : a flare , a signal mirror .
but he was eating lunch a mile away when the turk smashed into killed himself .
fourteen . we finally got him a room upstairs . should be up there in a couple of hours .
please don't go there .
we want them . you will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out - - until my people recover these disks .

knox , if you promise that this will be the end of it -
to be sure , captain .
i thought you say tuesday .

i know you lost all his work . maybe i could come down here and - -
that would be a monumental waste of time , wouldn't it , will ?
how do you know i come from america ?
yes .
sure .
what's your mother doing this afternoon ?
you didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you ?
does it ?
romeo and ethel the pirate's daughter .
you just said ...
he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom , said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all .
no . i mean yes .
i loathe bats .
why ?
i can't believe we had to give them the damn tape .
i don't know how to say this , jeff , except to just say it right out , so i'll say it . they do not want to air it .
what's wrong with walter , dude ?
what does it matter ? women just want to control you - - and talk about their feelings . they want to know why you're angry all the time - - and what can they can do to help - - so you tell them there's nothing - - nothing - - just leave me alone - - but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you - - until you just can't stand it anymore ! - - so you finally open up - - you pop like a blister - - and it all comes spewing out - - all your emotions - - your feelings - - your fears - - all of it ! and then they dump you .
damn !
last party all he wanted was sting - - not one person danced . tonight i'm doing superfreak , i don't care what he says . where is he ?
that doesn't sound normal .
she's evil . she's brilliant . be careful , nick .

danny , listen up . here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab . they're getting a very special delivery a week from this friday .
i agree .
you would do that , your majesty ?
but i'll never win that .

no you're not ...
she wouldn't tell me .

the truck ... the truck has severed most of her lower half .

i didn't mean to ...
you ain't giving the orders here !
hyperactive little fuckers , too . tough to keep up with in a wheelchair , i bet .

he doesn't look like he's going anywhere , bill . and if necessary , i can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private .

i - - just wanted to see her , i guess - - emily . and to see you too - - you and irene . and to let everyone know that , even though it may be difficult to comprehend now , this - - everything that's happening - - it's not forever . it doesn't mean " goodbye . "

it's a safety room . if anyone breaks into your house , you can hide .
his hatred of the federation is apparent . he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason . he is going after earth .
that episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy , but you're determined to ruin my day .

she was with me .

you were just a kid .
he is not going to kill the old man ?

" what sick , ridiculous , puppets we are , and what a gross , little stage we dance on . what fun we have , dancing and fucking , not a care in the world . not knowing that we are nothing . we are not what was intended . "
you said hello . to frank . you wanted to talk to someone ? . don ? . and little donny . you said something about momma loves you . and something about a meadow lane . something in an hour . i don't remember any more .

i <u> tapped </u> you .
where the hell have you been ?
how am i going to explain this to walter ?
your honor , <u> all </u> of this is speculation . including mr . hooks ' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call .
very simple . just bring him to ... that place we been using . mac , you take care of the details . call gerry g . in if you think you need him .
i want you to be safe , betsy . i want to know you're away from this place - - home again , where nothing can harm you - - nothing and no one .
what about me - jim called an abort - i didn't comply . i lost the team . i just need you to be safe .

i don't know , man . ask him ?
that way .
the queen wishes to publish an account of him .
god , i hate that time . that pick up stuff time . i just went through that before i came here . you know that song " patsy cline times two " i play ? that's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections .

only in times of extreme stress .
come on , mom , you can't be serious ...
whatever you're getting paid , i can give you twenty , maybe thirty bucks more .
doesn't hurt to ask . sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest .
... got to be <u> something </u> . she gives him the sacred ... and tells him : this is the traditional harvest offering , given to the man who ties the first sheaf , the last sheaf , whatever the fuck it is ...
fill for a second .
thanks , no . i despise any form of exercise . don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards .
boats . all anyone talks about is the wind . is it up , is it down . i can't live with a man who only talks about the wind .
where'd they go ?
romirez is dust .
- - she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin , tried to kill us - -
i suppose i might have told one or two people down the pub .
i know . i know . help me , here . look around .
but that wasn't so long ago . it couldn't have been more than ...
goodbye , grady .
oh , yeah .
are you sure they're your friends ?
you know , we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not .
i've never had meatloaf this good , what do you do to it ?

three hundred people watched ? nobody did anything ?
it's time for you to tell the citizens that commodus stole the money allocated for defending the german border . it's time to tell the citizens everything . will you write it ?

my name's lowell bergman ... i'm - -
it's called pro bono .
peter , please ...
the question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good . goodness comes from within . goodness is chosen . when a man cannot chose , he ceases to be a man .
goddamnit , mav , you really are a slow learner . don't worry , fung , i've got it .
what way ?
so--that's it . buckley took the body .
what do you know about my father ?

with four of them , i didn't use any kind of protection . wait , maybe it was three .
how can i help but mind ? i'm constantly humiliated ... just because i haven't money .
what are you doing ?
maybe you're afraid of what it says .
that was because of ... the reputation the gang had .
but , if he could be turned , he would be a powerful ally .
that's right . clips . look , i want you to know what we're talking about here . this isn't like tv only better . this is life . it's a piece of somebody's life . pure and uncut , straight from the cerebral cortex . you're there . you're doing it , seeing it , hearing it ... feeling it .
sure ... sure , mr . eddy . you gonna pick it up later , or tomorrow ?
coincidence , yes ? and how is our son ?
it's midnight . one half of paris is making love to the other half . look at the clock . one hand has met the other hand . they kiss . isn't that wonderful ?

trucker coffee . it's three times stronger . good for a hundred miles . that , a coupla perks , and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound .

charlie -
all i'm doing is feeling lousy about it . i don't know what to do . what do i do , kit ?
a . p . b ... he isn't breaking any law . he's a grown man ... he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that's what he wants to do .
you got that right .

how much does this cost ?
and if you lose me , you'll know that i loved you and wanted to go on loving you .
this really isn't a good time .
here ...

you and your government ! what's the matter with you ? don't you have any feelings ? your daughter ! what kind of man are you ?
he has every reason to freak out - - this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody !
you hearing me ?
look over there . that's the eye in the sky room .
you're not talking sense , mara !
it's mutating ... spreading like a disease .
he said to follow him .
it's you who's running out of time . you're starting to make mistakes now . you're wondering just how much i really know . just how close i'm getting ? well , i'm closer than you think , pal - - and i'm gonna nail your ass to the wall !
you still haven't answered my question .
i don't know .
all the professionals keep them in the trunk .
can i get up now ?
is that all there is to it ?
maybe just a hint or so . think hard .
after what we been hearing about your brother , i thought your throat'd be kind of dry .
you're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love ?
and admiral , it's the enterprise .
i'll never get it polished in time . give me a buckle , zack .
some .
j . j . , steve isn't ...
il signor ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali ?

river street ? i thought we was going to the garden .
what a chase !
you know , i had a crazy dream last night . it was about you .
it's everywhere . but water is always the door .
i told you she wasn't attractive ...
we never should have done this to him ...
gal , you ain't right yet .
your entire world view just went out the window . i couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight . we'll get through this . i promise .
charles ...
we're partners .
how'd you get in here ?
the pimp-mobile ? just made a few after market modifications . nitrous-oxide injection system , forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft , higher flowing fuel pump .

ma ! ... where's mary ... and little dan'l ?
okay . let's start with these strange powers of yours .
you've got to eat something agnes .
okay .
what took you so long ?
crossin ' the desert in a jalopy like this .
die in what sense ?
truman capote .
you want me to hunt them for you .
you and me ? dream on , desperado .
i'm going to paris .
i don't know . i once asked dr . maxwell the same question . he said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken .
all right , i got some scotch .
any particular reason ?
because you're still working for cohaagen .
billy prince is asking you to prom .
no you don't . you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet . you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem . you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say . am i right ?
she can't get a job , it's a depression . and we can't just throw her out on the street .
sometimes when she talks that way to me i'd like to ... curse her out and leave her forever ! or at least , defy her . but i couldn't . she's ill .
if not for data , you'd probably have been re-located by now .
well , what makes you think i haven't ?
sales , really ? that's great . what does she sell ?
we been seein ' you all along the way .
not more than a year ago , a mob hung a man for stealing a horse . for stealing a horse ! and , you dig up our dead .
we should take it with us to signal any planes .
start the countdown .
you should have proved that in a court of law .
and - - ?
because a movie star can never order straight from the menu . they have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu .
yes . yes .
yes , but i'm not working for you any more . i'm on the other side .
it's a blackcard and bad card , but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things .
to the black pearl .
i'm not sure ... i might have .
fuck legal terms . we're talking about human beings here . sick people . a whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years . they need their money now ! we gotta get ' em to agree to the arbitration , ed . we gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to - -
you'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone .
let them fight .
i made you , and i can destroy you .
sure . bases loaded .
how could he be a fake ?
who did ?
who either doesn't care , or could have me killed . either way , natalie's still gonna find out .
very well , mr . chekov , see to it . viewer off .
and do what ? take on his whole posse ?
we have to !
what's that on your forehead , pal ?
what's wrong with him ?
i am going to the cops . there's a full moon tonight . jack was right . i ...
you're the spawn of satan . you got it in you .

free , if you're the president .
schneider ?
with you clowns watching my back ? what do you think ?
it's the gibson , it's finding us too fast .
mister washington , why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving mister bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance .
oh , make that uniform blue .
yes . i'm tired .
i have to get back .
he'll be back before curfew .
a what ?
get in , mom ! i have to open .
don't screw around with me . you know what i'm talking about . you're taking those sats . you're taking those sats or your cd collection is history . you're taking those sats and you're going to college . you're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair , but buddy your taking them .
well , listen , uh ... good luck with the joint , huh ?
oh , god . i see it !
what do you mean ? i'm starving .
you're a poet and didn't know it .
i'm an orphan .
hi , marty !
they will surely kill us here . it's over here . we have to take the chance .
but it's only for thirty seconds !
you are what ... ?
oh , no ! it's not for you . you're only going to get married . mrs . dickson and i are going to go on the honeymoon .
you're never going to believe this , but the canyon road ... we were on it not two hours ago ... well , it's completely ...
a field trip ? maybe i'll join you . see you tomorrow .
yeah . sorry .
he's the boss of all the bosses , and i respect him .
why you left .
someone else can help you . someone else can make you happy .
not too bad .
luke needs help . we must go back .
his eyes are open .
i think so .
you what ?
fine , fine . how's your family ?
mr . president , just what do you think you're doing ?
but they both worked at the white house ?
yes .
why not ? what's wrong , juliet ? aren't you curious ? don't you wonder what he died from ?
he's nuts .
don't let ' em fight .
get down to word processing . help jamey look .
she said the frog came from around the copper ridge . she must've been behind the hill .
exactly .
ch-charlie m !
if you can catch him .
just a moment , dear . we can't have it , rose . can you behave yourself - - or not ? that is the question , to behave or not to behave , to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee - - that is the coil shuffling question . if you can't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs . hillyer and i mean it . i point my rigid finger right at your nose , rose , and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you ... this is a final warning . do you hear me ?
hildy - - i can't . i'm busy - - i - - let me up , hildy . earl williams has escaped - -
i do believe the monsignor finally got a point .
what ?
there's a lot of things i don't see any sense to . but make up your mind . learn to read or - - - - go back and watch the horses .
wreck is a harsh term . disturbed is more like it . mildly disturbed even .
you don't follow the bodies , and you don't follow procedure . you do it by instinct . think like him . do what has to be dane .
and what're you whispering for ?
many happy returns of the day ...
- - listen to the man - -
thanks , cleo . see you tomorrow .
try and control this ...

i just wish you coulda seen the movie .
that's what i would have done .
what was the bribe ? what am i worth to you ?
that again .
they have these little sticks , vince . they call them " chomp chomps " , and when you get these girls going , you have to stick ' em in their mouths .
- - so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i . d . , and he gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses . totally irrational , totally disoriented , doesn't know where he is , what day it is , alla that stuff . all they got was his name . they figure he's stoned out of his mind , it's some kinda psychotic episode , so they're gonna bring him ...
i won't ask again .
ok .
i'm a sales rep . i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i'm a girl .

you really are pathetic , you know that ? mathew grimes is only one letter in my alphabet . he is nothing compared to me .

i don't understand .

toy ?
just a minute , maxie . somebody ...
are you reasonably awake ?
you're great with the advice , clark . maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column .
this chinaman who peed on my rug , i can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about ?
what's the matter , you don't know this trick ?
you just ask me how we gonna do it . that's what i'm here for , tell you how . we the experts .

schoenick ... your lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move ...
i can't ! i can't put him in the pot . i can't put a live thing in hot water .
i'm gonna do somethin with it .
he's still looking for that old file ... can't you just appropriate it ?
okay , so i just got things started . but you could build on that . you could keep it going .
she says i should wait . she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life . she says that i'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet . in a mature manner .
then let's act like friends . let's talk . i know this is a new place , and - -
what gets into you all ? we study the problem . we've been studying it for damn well near a century , yes , but we get no further with our studies . you've got a good home here , good loving parents , you've got not too bad of a brain . is it some devil that crawls inside of you ?
how do you do , miss viridiana !
did you read in the paper today , about the man who was walking his dog ? he was attacked , and his wallet and his watch were taken . and then , while he was still lying unconscious , his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes . it happened four blocks from here .
we're gonna get married .

a pet idea--you know--pension bill - - save the buffalo--you've got * one * notion you think would be good for this country , haven't you ?

it's high time you realized , honey babe , that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language .
he doesn't think you run mind games on him .
do you want to become one ?
maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job ? having status ? and maybe for the audience , it's just voyeurism ? something to do on a sunday night . and maybe it won't change a fucking thing . and people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry . used up ! broke , alone !

when i found out you were going i just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... i'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me .
not as long as i'm alive .
what's wrong , sweetheart ? somethin ' botherin ' you ?
don't remember .
you have to understand . when i was growing up , he was gone more than he was here . and i started thinking - - maybe he has a second life somewhere else . with another house , another family . he leaves us , he goes to them . or maybe there is no family . maybe he never wanted a family . but whatever it is , maybe he likes that second life better . and the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place .
it's the goddamn grand canyon !
you don't even know these guys .
we missed you in church today , frank .
it's not our mistake !
but what about heather and ram and kurt ?
le sommes nous ?

you can look in the bathroom if you want . people are always curious about that , like what happens when you flush .
i sure didn't expect her to drop dead .
you want me to go against a priest ? get excommunicated ? you think i'm nuts ?
i'd say logic more than faith . the odds were on my side .
okay , and listen , i would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life .
you liar !
sidney , please , dear , if you feel nervous ...
i'm okay .
you didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid , tasteless , cruel animal jokes .

good .
mrs . silvera .
what about larry - -
why yours alone ? tell me how it was done ! ! !
do you think the assistant , what's his name ...

i am riding to dublin myself , and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you , i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap .

didn ' you have no breakfast ?
hang on , voltaire .
for bravery .
i changed my mind . i'd pick the dangerous one .
we don't know who he is ...  ... i'm going to talk to that little girl .
you'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness .
get a hold of yourself .
... " down safely , " crew perished in the crash ...
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego . you asked for blackmail , let me give you blackmail : mr hale-fellow-well-met , about to open his own business here , has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years , probably including half the people sitting on that jury . well , it finally caught up with him--these dopes , it always does ; someone threatened to spill it . somebody knew his dirty little secret , just like your wife says . they called , they demanded money ...
skipper , do we get hazard pay for this ?

bogutude . blow it off .

lucky for them they didn't .
but it must have been wynant . i should have known if it weren't his voice .
sorry . boy i'll tell ya , if early found a picture of me like that i'd be black and blue for a week .
he squeezed money out of you ?
she won't even know .
no ... but sometimes i feel that way . what i meant was , i'd be willing to trade for the photographs .
never
or do you have a taste for the good life , ted ? it's in your blood .
but it wasn't supposed to be like this . when i met you we were the same people and now we're not , and ...
i wouldn't talk .
we've never sent this much with one courier .
where is it ?
but ... her army's so small now ...
is it done ?
he'll find us . we go talk to him .
no , they're not .
if stage two was completed , it was underground - - she said it was going to be underground .
you hunt us like animals - - do you know how many you have slaughtered ? !
well you could say : " dennis "
he sure is .
my name is carpenter and i'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house .
how nice .
frank . hey , man . you alright ?
i thought you were taking me to see mama ?
what you've already decided . you're not really asking .
i'm coming over to your side , that's what . and i have a feeling i'm making a big mistake .
i waited and waited and then i had an idea and wired albany to send me a hundred dollars so i could get out on bail ... i don't know what they'll think - - they sent it to the police station !
look over there .
me and her got a connection . read this part . read the part about stuffing her stocking .
still sweet .
please do . i'm a man who appreciates a good firearm .
i don't think so . i've fallen in love . this is what people who've fallen in love look like .
you knew i was seeing kristina , right ?
oh no , mr . merrick . no . no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment .
you wouldn't understand .
how did this happen ?
when did you find this out ?
i even moved into mabel dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy cobb might start looking around .
he is a capable man .
on the house .
when i married myles , we were both maladjusted misfits . we still are . and we've loved every minute of it .
i can't get over how cute the girls in this city are .
- - black .
you're sorry . christ , eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit ...
i didn't think it would . she's calling herself l . a . joan this - week . last week it was dakota . guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything .
yes . he traced her to that motel , out on the old highway ...
i once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep . all the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves . i saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles , all the way back to its den , just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill .
you're working daffy's block . he was going to break your kneecaps . pick - pockets can be so bitchy sometimes . i told him you were with us , so that's two you owe me .
i don't know . probably not .
no ... we can come back in a couple of weeks . besides , if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right .
mr . kovic . we're not here about your taxes .
don't worry about that now , child , it will all come back to you now that you're home ...
then you shoulda known she wasn't buying . she was just long-term leasing ' you . ah , nickie . except for that rare twenty-second twitch , there ain't nothin ' about sex i don't hate . but of course , i'm irish . plus i got <u> real </u> problems . i'm worried i might have to put you in over m . j . there's something going on here , the commissioner is targeting her now , i can't leave a woman in that position . but the thing is , how can i move <u> you </u> in , if you go on acting like a teenage asshole ?
what do you keep making me out to be ?
oh , you helped me here , all right , white boy . you and your goddam memo . you needed to prove your point , uh ?
i'm fine . she's back on . hello ? i'm here .
believe it or not - josephine predicted the whole thing .
well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason - -
look , i didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there , i just thought you'd call when you came back . you didn't and ... don't blow it just because of this garbage between us .
asking the wrong person again .
... kids ?
for cathy . for her birthday . by the way , where is she ?
maybe dinner .
why don't we forget my goddamn psychiatrist and deal with the task at hand . this is important .
well--he calls it the bermuda triangle . he said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again .
sure . yeah .
but how long ?
i could use a little help . we have to return the van soon .
what are you going to do with your <u> third </u> ?
i want to thank you .
i don't know .
dave , i find your story simply not believable .
that's my trick !
pretty much what you'd expect .
i like you , dil - -
there was a time when i would have welcomed it .
how much did they get from the safe ?
well , i'll be - !
well , this explains the music .
this is what they call the jack . hi , jack !
i was about to throw in the towel .
you've been drinking . your tipsy .
could you stop , please . you're giving me a headache .
you like them , don't you , boss .
the forager's back .
fiddlesticks ! she don't hear it . got better music to listen to than that . there - - that's what i mean .
im well aware of your stake in this , 007 . if you have a point , get to it .
he's a boy , dude .
i'm sick of it . i can't watch you this way . you're too drunk all the time . there's too many girls . i can't ... i don't wanna talk about it . i made up my mind .
my god , what a disgrace you are ! you shame me , you shame the family . you're nothing but a cheap little tart !
layton ! oh shit !
because i already tried once .
you going to the lighthouse ?
what happened to playing a hunch ?

where at ?
what are you talking about ?
take her with you !
roger , wolf one .
hello ! . . . yeh ?
i'm sorry . i had the television set had the television -
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody . you saw it coming as well as i did . dodge had his plans , starting with scuttling the boat . and greer too , except he went nuts . couldn't take it , i guess . could've happened in the middle of downtown anchorage . but did it make him any less dangerous ? i don't think so .
what's that ?
good . from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded , that the movement of your lips is being read . got it ?
oh jack , i'm so warm . i'm burning up .
onscreen .
comrades ! comrades !
you know how i spent last weekend ? walking his damned dog .
when are you going back ?
augh ?
look , i really appreciate your help , enid , but let's face it , this is hopeless .
... people that were made to be parents , and people who were not made to be parents ... my parents , were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway . i don't want us to be that way ellen .
the bones will be there when we get back . that's the nice thing about them . they never run away . and besides , you got me into this . i don't intend to be alone with these people .
how did you , know the rest ? i never taught you the rest of it .
my god . my dress . we have to find it . and burn it . and shut the door .
i came back for you , geoff . we're going to be together again .
who said write ? jesus , jack can't read . you gotta tell it to him-tell him something for chrissake .
i don't feel like i make any impression on people ... at office parties i spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them , so the platters will always look full . i don't start conversations because i have no idea how to end them ... i think i'm just meant to live in the background of things .
you saw a forgery .
i've watched you once or twice . you surf like it's some kind of street fight . you jerk along from moment to moment , fighting everything that comes at you . always trying to win .
man , i wanna smoke a joint .
why ?
cameron ?
you want me to put it here ?
no ! no - - no ! here - - you can have your old slippers - - but give me back toto .
what ?
whyn't you kill me and find another cab .
troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me .
what you say ?
it's getting dark . go home .
you just expect me to whip something off , that it ?
incredible . we should take a drive before they're gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
hello , helen .
well , at least you're accomplished at something ...
sam ! ! !
i've seen it before .
man , hey - - maybe you are an entopologist after all .
after you have frozen , your icy tomb will plummet back to gotham .
why me ?
lord , never thought i'd live to see my boy in prison .
maybe because they never do . so don juan , you pass out on all your dates ?
what's wrong ?
see ya .
sure plan to .
no , but that definitely sounds like shots and i don't where it's comin ' from - -
dear miss laury ... i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them com - anches the late mister futterman told us about ...
how about you ? are you going to win ?
look , jake . she gave us mulwray's real phone number and address .
uh-huh . well , i still jerk off manually .
i'm just tryin ' to figure it out .
consuelo screamed too - - and clo clo . why did you do it ? why ? quick . tell me why ?
cecile , i think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did .
it worked !
but honey , i'll be good . i promise . i love you sweetie . i'm just tryin ' to help these two be part of things .
yeah .
they're waiting to see my father .

he's okay .
keith richards , dean martin ...
it was nothing . we're not ... he just makes me laugh . when was the last time we laughed ? any of us ?
it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference .
yeah . i said a week , and i've overstayed myself ...
waiting in the apartment next door .
yeah .
i want to stay .
whatever gave you that idea ?
before we do , you might like to freshen up . and you'll certainly want to change
it's all right . that part of your life is over with . right ?
for sure ...
he'll say that ?
you see - - the electricity's been neutralized - - all over the world .
she's cute as a button .
i hate to say this , but this place is getting to me . i think i'm getting the fear .
thank you , my love . ]
sing !
this really isn't a good time .
don't call me that .
i ain't a idiot , asshole .
no--i'm furious ! - - nobody seems to do anything about it - -
what do you want me to say , frank ? i was killing men when i was fifteen . i like getting shot at . i like riding out of town with a posse at my back . this is a helluva better life than farming .
in this courtroom , mr . miller , justice is blind . to matters of race , creed , color , religion . and sexual orientation .
... everyone has been very kind .
... you leaving ?
not at all . you have your life . and i have mine .
i think i'm gonna move back east .
okay , shorty ... see you in the morning ... i'm going to have a little - - word with willie .
she's sharp as a marble .

why would you let me go back ?
i'm still thinking about it .
what the fuck were you doing here ?
he's going to be dropping bombs on mandalay ! they're going to be shooting at him !
we've got to get an abortion ?
that's what i have to tell you , rafe . it wasn't a choice . it - -
nothing . no mountains . no castles . looked like a giant parking lot . it wasn't even called hell .
the tall trees ...

i dunno .
i'm also good enough to go pro .
don't worry . i'm gonna get you out of here .
who ?
babe , it's not me ! i love you ! it's god !
i am the light of this city . <u> and </u> i am its mean , twisted soul . does it really matter who's the " mayor " ?
where has it been for the last seven years ?
no , i guess i'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it .
that's stupid .
man , el-rage is el-rage . you know him .
and the fear you showed at our last session ? how did you overcome that ?
these were killers . conklin had them all jacked up . they were dobermans .
mmm , it tastes so good . mr . deeds , i don't know how i can ever thank you .
i can't stay on this show . i gotta get some answers . otherwise i'm telling you , i'm going to do something drastic .
marylin ! what have i done ?
huh ?
the abbe's sending me away . he fears for me here , what with the likes of you - -
so , you called me up , because you just wanted to have a drink before you ... go find a hotel ?
i finally got through to sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had : he would have told the grand jury about haldeman , he was ready to , only nobody on the grand jury asked him the goddamn question .
you just got back from a four game road trip .
you're crawling around like a - -
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born . louisa was henry's younger sister , and she and the baby moved in with us . four or five years go by , and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue , tail between his legs , wanting to patch things up with louisa . i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door . they're both big men , those two , and if they ever started to tangle , you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor . i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet . and the poor girl never came back .
i'm feelin ' dis ' !
oui .
you don't like new york ?
i took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests .
this is a league game . this determines who enters the next round - robin , am i wrong ?

i'm tired of running away . besides , we past this place two times already . we're not getting nowhere .
just low .
before it crashed , they dumped three cases filled with millions . they're using hal for a bird dog . once they find the money , hal's dead . so get on your radio , contact frank , have him pick you up , then contact the state police , the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here ! do it jessie .
polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in avril bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges . i couldn't call them in , there's no phone out there .

yeah . it's been twenty-seven years .
don't you guys ever knock ?
i've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen , i just know they do . so the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences . which you did ... you took that sonuvabitch out .

alvy , you are totally incapable of enjoying life .
yes , doctor .

not at all . she brought me my fan mail . i had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me . but i guess that's the best thing about working in the movies . you make so many friends . i want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake .
it's not like that ...
it's nothing to do with you . it's me they wanted , not you . why do you interfere in other people's business ?
oh , sweet glory hallelujah ...
spock , that was actually funny .

yes ... ah , do you know why you're here ?
i do it for love .
lis , i want to , i really do , but ... oh , i can't .
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices .
that's easily arranged . but first , back into bed .
hey , listen , i love her . she's sophia's best friend . i never said any of this , alright . i'll deny it on the stand ... you guys are gonna have kids . that is so great . maybe that's what this is all about . maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore . you know adults don't do this for a living . you guys are gonna have your kids , you'll be directing - - one asshole in the family is enough . sophia knew that intuitively . look at clair . clair's a mess . make sure she gets the epidural . forget that natural childbirth shit . everything's going to be what it's supposed to be . " life is but a walking shadow . a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more ... " and speaking of me , the role of leo in your film ?
eggiwegs . i would like to smash ' em . pick up th elot and f ... owww ... he slams his hand down and cries out with pain .
you consider your life easy .
we gotta let the slack out , cledus ; this is costing us time .
thanks .
i'd buy it !
unless the gun was slanted up .
what is this business with you and explosives ? do you think you're immune ?
i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i'm about to launch a brand new magazine called " exposed ! " an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia , ohio .
alright , guys . we stop this <u> now </u> .
dawn ...
no ... could you ?
she spoke ? susan spoke ?
i never said any of that !
... like macaroni and cheese ...
have you ever been on television ?
look , bobby , i don't know what happened , and i don't want to know what happened , but something's up .
i'm not ... i'm not ... you're gettin ' a bus ... you're gettin ' a bus ... the jet's comin ' into kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need ? what else can i get you ? listen , i don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the fbi guy ...
dad stop it !
hey , you dealt us this hand , we're playing it all the way . move .
well , i guess i'll come back then .
none of that innocent stuff , you double-crossing hyena ! you stuck bruce baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch , and you frisked his wallet ! now , give me that wallet or i'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either ! it'll be for life !
she's alright , isn't she ?
no , we're stealing .
good evening , sir .
what kind of friend do you think i am ?
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here ? this will always be the ghetto .
don't believe everything you hear on tv .
you must think i'm blind and stupid . i've already gotten the birds and bees from bobby . the president doesn't have to double-barrel me .
what is it ? what's going on ?
got it . good tip .
i work with ramada . we're doing some pictures together .
sure , anything's poss ...
you know those little dogs you see people with ?
that's right , you have the right to remain silent .
i took out three hundred , but i'm only gonna bet with one . i figure if we buy a lot of chips , the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit , then we trade back the chips at the end of the night . you gotta be cool though .
i can't wait to hear your opening argument . " ladies and gentlemen of the jury ... the defense will prove that jason voorhees did not kill all of these people . they , in fact , committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard ... "
no more revolts .
engaged .
steven - -
hold on , ray ! half-price ! have you gone crazy ?
dracula ?
no , of course , you want to get out of town .
ben , think about all the people we can help if this works - -
i know this sounds weird , mr . sutphin , but the department of motor vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of mr . stubbins ' pupils .
then i'll find a ship - - i'll hire a ship .
shh !
yeah . it's not just the chip , it has a pci bus . but you knew that .
i'd rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can . this ship is bad . it watches you .
no . the good news is i found the problem and it's not our equipment . there's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed .
i understand . maybe we'll see each other after the show ...
don't look at me . i'm just a pilot . i got you here ... you've got to do the rest .
damn it , be sure ! !
no .
are you surprised that i know what it is ?
don't get yourself all worked up - -
sorry i didn't get her back in time .
he's a good boy .
so what ?
look , jason , i need some fast answers if i'm ever gonna fix what i've done .
didn't go anywhere else ? no errands , no purchases ? just straight to the boat . that's the truth .
she's rich . we're still married . we have no pre-nup .
wait a minute - -
that's when it happened ?
every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him - by the time you find him , the lions will be dead .
i know , look at his little hands .
i think he's lying to us . i could see it in his eyes .
shi ... sorry , honey . i was having the weirdest dream .
just lucky i guess .
it's a school night ... back by nine .
you never know .
you sure you can keep - -
what else can you do ?
where does he sell it ?
where would we find him ?
by who ?
let's go niggers .
yes .
the academy is fantastic ... of course , they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know . most of the instructors are very conservative pilots . you can fly circles around them ... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing , and you get a lot of discipline ... but after you graduate , don't join the star force - - go free-lance . it's the only way to get into the action ... i can't wait until my hitch is up .
dieter asked where i was . he expected me here . maybe someone was assigned to bring me here .
not leftovers ?
want to buy a bed ?
what ?
don't tell me you're a mud carrier .
i know . but the toxicologist i been talking to ? he gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure . and everything you all have is on that list .
we were , we are , but this is perfect for you .
why wouldn't i ?
don't bullshit me , george . i don't see you very much , i don't want to waste the time .
let me have a look .
there's a man downstairs . he brought us eggs . he might stay .
he's a cop , vincent , he's french and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now !
peugot convertible ...
you're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller .
not in that way ; you're always looking for company .
who is she ?
thanks .
only if it's no closer than a hundred feet .
i didn't want to come to work anyway . i hate this freakin ' place .
a hundred and five years ? he really hung on , didn't he .
i don't know ! shit ! let's just play it by ear . he may not know . he may just give me a ticket .
of human bondage .
it means it was homemade .
yes .
all right , cop . i want my money .
i care about what happened . the truth . i'm a student of history , remember ?
matter ? with me ? nothing's the matter .
where ?
but can there be a society composed of just two ants ?
at least we'll have a house to show for it .
whah is dissdee ?
well , i don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other , ben . i do think you should know the consequences of what you've done . i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon .
you know why they're turning on me ? they're not serious about power , that's why . they're playing with power . they're forgetting the national interest . in the old days , people knew how to hold power , how to set limits . they wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary . all they care about now are their egos , looking good at cocktail parties ...
i'm on it !
well , it's on ! we're gonna rock . linda , call vaughan . tell him to get over here . i'd like him to be here . i owe him a good time .
sure , tracy .
i know .
but sergeant ...
i can't believe you are doing this to me ! <u> ghosts </u> . i am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight . otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic . my agent , bernard , is bringing some woman who writes for <u> architectural digest </u> . in fact , no one here tonight has not been in <u> vanity fair </u> . except you .
yeah , old times .
mr . dean - -
i think so .
jack . i said the kids are asleep ...
how was your date ?
you think that's really him ?
i missed ya . what can i say ?
how strange you are ! when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused . you seemed almost offended . and now , here you are , making me so very happy all of a sudden . thank you , my child !
why he's argumentative ?
so ... that sure is something .
then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long .
she's grown up some , hasn't she ?
... her face is careworn .
well , you're right there . ten minutes ago i had a job .
no .
the ropes are coming loose .
her husband docks tomorrow , does he ?
in the past two days i've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .
yeah . some of them ... yeah , some of them are very big .
join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition ? thank you anyway . and i like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point .
yes , you do . you always back down . you assume blame that isn't yours , you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off , you buckle like a belt .
it's the busy season .
she's the one person i could always count on . and she's saved me more times than she realizes . i owe her everything .
laura . what's wrong this morning ?
i do not marry tonight .
now stop it and listen to me right now . i am dying , i got sick ... now i fell down and i'm not ... don't - -
fuck your curfew . most sixth graders can stay out later than you .
you don't know how crazy i am .
desperation has driven me past etiquette , all the way to frenzy .
this is a japanese company , you know ? they figure a married woman , she's on the way out the door ...
throw out all this junk . burn it ! this room crawls with tropical disease .
you mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions .
now i'm going to tell you the truth . i really came in here because i was bored stiff by the party .
i think so . i'm not sure ... are you ?
what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails - - you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that .
i don't know how ...
not a drop . maybe the guy works for the red cross .
oh lean over here , lady . lean this way .
i guess you could call it a hobby . it doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it , but i do it every day . rain or shine , sleet or snow . sort of like the postman . sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job , and my job is just a way to support my hobby .
oh . thank you .
what ?
you know what ? it's christmas eve . and you look clean - - i mean , you're normal-looking . [ resolutely , for her own benefit ] it's christmas eve , and i have a couch .
i never knew my father . did you ?
i don't think so .
perhaps ... perhaps ... i'm afraid i must first ask you to pass a test . i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors .
perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer .
i know . we can't just keep going through the motions .
yeah . even after that . you didn't take it out on me , except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now . but i'd say you've been very fair . i just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple .
no !
who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter ?
how the hell did we get this detail ?
yeah , two things pete , that - -
at what ?
oh , i would love that , wally .
i can't help it , i'm just taller than you .
since we're being honest , guess i should tell you . i'm dropping out of school and going pro .
they're all pinned down . can't even get to the door .
listen , i'd like to , but frankly .. i'm not even sure where it is , or even ...
no . we're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding .
my point , dude , is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million . am i wrong ?
you just drove a fucking customer away , barry .
you claiming it was all a misunderstanding , ken ?
this is a bad time , henry . i'm busy just now . what do you want ?
it's much easier this way . come on , step up ...
annie , it's liz . how's grace ?
did you like her to watch ?
but let me remind you that this treatment is ... experimental .
are you sure about that ?
- - we had the gun on him tonight - - the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five . 96 miles an hour , 98 , 97 , 97 . 97 . he's got the best young arm i've seen in 30 years .
then what ?
i saw it .
it is unlikely . america , perhaps . there is great anti-communist feeling in america .
mr . pink .
... i don't know .
of course .
i'm fine . thanks .
hey , i tried to get her off the phone .
once again , don't call me eugene . a recent unknown intruder penetrated , using a superuser acount , giving him access to our whole system .
it's not .
right . why ?
what did you say , boy ? !
you're a wonderful man . two o'clock is a good time . here's the key in case he's asleep . open the curtains for him , so he sees god's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best .
i ain't fuckin ' sure , bobby .
i got it . i just don't got it on me .
relax . if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert .
there are just two things i'm interested in : love and death . for the moment , i have none of the two !
okay ! how do we turn this thing on ?
it's on the table .
like the light is scalding it .
his parents ? is that what he told you ? his parents ?
hope i didn't hurt him too bad .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in , but i'm going to tell you the truth . there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding , things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway . that's where we come in .
look joyce , i need your key to the files , not advice , okay ? this is a complex case .
you want to " profile " me ? find out what makes me " tick " ? write about me , go on a talk show , give me a nickname ?
what ? no frigging way , man . i'm not touching that thing .
you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier .
go fuck yourself .
don't be ridiculous . for months i've had the best private detective in new york looking for miss gibson .
i can't read .
i guess i could teach you some things .
i know . this is a dream , sarah .
i hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff .
don't worry , it won't come to that .
the only thing that scares me , mister o'connell , are your manners .
if it comes to that , i'll do us both . let's see that it doesn't here , i'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine .
thank you .
walter ... i don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get ... together . you know what i mean ?
planned what ?
i feel like shit ...
you get a new fence .
something pretty .
so he met me and i offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price , with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy i know in london .
85,000 dollars .
had to get away for his health , i suppose .
i'll knock ' em in , charlie . i can do it . blow his fuckin ' head off . get rid of the bastard for good .
that's what it was you planned , wasn't it ?
now turn around . i'm going to cuff you .
you know you did !
damn it , man ! you're talking about my mother !
i'm telling you . it's not drugs . it's something more . someth -
we can grow three primary crops in a season and , if we have some luck , we get a forth . the temperature is generally mild .
i have the gun .
look around , sweetheart .
just tell me who's closer to the wall ?
i want no more trouble , mr . fennyman . as i explained to you , the theatre business
but it's not a year from now , is it ?
will shakespeare !
wow , i've never seen him like this . he doesn't usually like guys .
bob ?
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred .
yeah ?
maybe you better just drive me home .
seven - - - - queen .
aye , for us there is .
what did you do to yours ?
he asks when he can come to visit you . he left his address .
of course you don't know .
damnit , yllo ! i don't like it .
stan and i're okay .
how come you know all this shit ?
of course .
they're your fans , your audience -
i see .
wow , you walked out with my mother ?
wait or act .
we don't have that kinda time , boss , i don't think prague's gonna be around much longer . i've gotta go now . i've got a lot of bad guys to kill .
all night ?
it's a pretty piece of land .
they killed her . and they're trying to buy it ...
of course .
you're doing calligraphy ?
check it out butt-head , tv !
that's quite enough , kalen .
yeah , baby ...
wait ! first i give you special fuck !
well , george , i invest for a lot of people . i make a lot of money for them . more than they could do for themselves .
look , nick . you want us to pack up , we'll pack up .
whaddo we do ?
okay , stand by in operations . let's go .
come on in .
he's dead ? that's fine . you won't see me shedding any tears over him ! oh george , you must take me with you !
i'm gonna take him , goose .
were you in the men's room at the edmonson drive in flea market on saturday , september 19th ?
only the sword will settle this .
it's as far as it goes !
or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat .
what ?
i'm not saying it's a bad thing , in fact , i think it's something we should take pride in . i'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here .
you are not my priest , aramis ! you would not be , even if i had one .
no .
then tomorrow you will have the pages .
clear and rolling .
wanna go to the comic book store ?
when did he say it , norma ?
what is it man ?
about an hour and a half , because that's all the longer i've been gone .
i like grandma's cooking ...
and on march 24 , thomas sandefur , ceo of brown & williamson had you fired . and the reason he gave you ?
oh dear . he wasn't friendly during the filming ?
after visiting congress i know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses ! ah , if she only knew that the most important men in the country - - possibly the world - - are sitting at this table ...
thank you .
you shut up you , fuckin ' retard . get your shit and get out of here . that was a wake-up slap , frank . remember . reality , like i said . don't forget any bit of what i said to you and we'll be fine .
you mean from it .
bigger and better .
you wouldnt have a cigarette , would you ?
nothing .
i'm terrible at this . i blurt . i'm a blurter . your parents ... they ... well ... they exist no further . skinny-dipping . the amazon . piranhas . it wasn't pretty .
i like you .
clair is a hovering mother .
take a deep breath and count to ten . it's not that kind of work . you're lily , right ?
you fixing to add overtime to a twelve - hour day ? the union ain't gonna like it .
no . but , honest . what are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks ? i don't even know what they mean - - " beat them off with a stick . "
enzo ?
and you are ?
take the elevator to the very bottom , go left , down the crewman's passage , then make a right .
i don't know ... but it does .
we could make a run for it ?
soggy bottom boys - i don't precisely recollect , uh -
hon , did you get expelled ?
i'm not .
i think you're different .
free !
and the tiny hairs on your arm . are they all standing up ?
she's real eat , drink and be merry girl .
i'm sorry , dr . smyslov , but i'm really not at liberty to discuss this .
she jumped . she'd been depressed .
remove him at once .
i don't know-like two-thirty , three .
twinkeys !
yeah .
i can't . what if it's the wallaces ! ? we'd get annie in trouble .
that's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty .
sleaze to peddle .
i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox . i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game . my wife is from boston . lillian ziegler ?
how would you propose we handle it , doctor ?
it sounded like brenda .
might , if i was asked ...
just sent ' em through .
i've got one now .
nobody's got anything on me , brother , sir . i've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now .
okay , what are you going to need to clean it up
don't i always ?
i could stay here forever ...
because i'm an idiot . how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist ? none ! only a jerk like me could do it . besides i wasn't lucky . when i was a kid there was the war ! when i grew up , another war ! now it's all different . times have changed . and you want to be a dope like me ? huh ? answer me !
son . little excitement out at the reservation this morning . wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun . bia handled it . i went by for backup .
my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . hes decisive , vigilant . and he makes an excellent omelette .
you up for it ?
you're backstage at the encore of creation .
i hate people who try to peddle comfort . but , mary , you shouldn't mourn for jacqueline . life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind . it's better this way .
please see to mister bromden .
did you sleep with her ?
what's that noise ?
' take a little tip from mack the knife ... '
' bout six months ago i took a man up to lo mung bridge . he was regular army too . shot himself in the head . i brought his body back down .
i should go

a triumph . when did you get here ?
nothing much - - just that it might not be a cat this time .
epilepsy .
she talks to herself .
more fun win battle ?
- - 73 , and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket , and for crying out loud , ben , be a man and just get it over with . i would have if i'd had the chance .
i don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry !
no . i never could . you must regret having had the invitation sent .
stop bullying me . everybody's bullying me .
that smart ? !
good . i'll see him in there .
oh , i'll just mosey around here and there .
don't hang up on me .
son , lots of people tell me i'm a gifted man , but i still can't see around corners .
the man lost a child , for christ's sake ...
checkmate .
why are you here ? hmmmmmmmm ! ! ! ok .

why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to ?
so , we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
four hundred and fifty dollars . is it a deal ?
i don't know what he thinks ... i don't know what i think ... i don't even know why i'm talking about it ... it's silly ... i'm getting too old for this sort of thing ...
you still didn't have to choke me .
your highness , forgive this intrusion , but ...
look , you're only sort of insane , really . people like you can lead semi-normal lives . you could get a job ...
you see what i been puttin ' up with ? as soon as i walk through the door i'm hit with this shit . i tell ' m what you told me about us stayin ' put and mr . white whips out his gun , sticks it in my face , and starts screaming " you motherfucker , i'm gonna blow you away , blah , blah , blah . "
you know about sanctuary ! i know you do ! you have to help us ! you don't have a choice ! it isn't your decision ! ! tell us .
they'll never take me alive .
that was just a mix up .
a few bars !
you're an investor , is that it ?
i thought you said the eggs weren't ...

explains the private detective . he traced her to the bates place . what'd he exactly say when he called you ?

playing hooky again ?
not for years .
she's been arrested .
daddy !
well that's stupid . this is my park just as much as it is theirs . you think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something ?
it's not going very well - - and it's our last day .
does the phrase " nosy " have any meaning to you , lily ?
i thought it was great . you were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie .
because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea .
it's alright , it was thrown away . no one wants it . it's just that it's a little dirty , that's all .
come on , julie . you saw his room .
you know , when you dumped me for that wimp , i thought , cole , she'll be back . god wants the two of you to be together , and sure enough ...
loved that cat pretty well , didn't she ?
wait , wait , wait a minute ... that doesn't make sense .
the land and the king are one , my son . if he stutters we falter . he's getting batter , and so are we .
yes . au revoir ...
an exorcism was just held for birdson . it failed . disastrously . which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body . i was wondering , perhaps you'd like to go meet henry . he's pretty amazing .
huh ?
sorry about last night .
that is correct . lieutenant dunbar , i came to apologize for the accommodations . ordinarily , of course , we never put officers up with enlisted men .

you rich kids ... are all the same !
i'm getting electrolysis . it's working , but it takes time . so meanwhile i have to ...
i've never dealt with death before . i wasn't alive when my grandparents died . i wish i could know . i mean , all this ... could just be in our heads . now it feels like it's everywhere .
i'll be all right .
yes ! yes ! hallelujah !
very insightful .
no .
this one i have watched a long time . all his life has he looked away ... to the horizon , to the sky , to the future . never his mind on where he was , on what he was doing . adventure , excitement ... a jedi craves not these things !
you can believe that if you want . i talk to guys like you , and i want to commit suicide . you get that weight-lifting set i sent you ?

i felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles .
i need to find this technician , or anyone else who knows about project manticore . they would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work ... if i can track down one of them .

insolent young cub !
the man has friends . and they're not likely to forgive me if i testify against him .
it was an honest mistake . ridgeway ... ridgeroad ... ridgeway road .

it's cold .
and we'll all have to go to work for a living .
it's too late .

a notch above the storage room .
i won't apologize for this . and i won't hide it . not for anybody .

you're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst .
it wasn't a sign . it was a coincidence .
ahh .
i think investment advice from a dead man , it's a bad idea . how does it feel to be dead ?
molly , dear molly . go to bed now , baby ...
it's their presidential suite .
too late , your kid worships me . and your wife - - she's an animal . even i can't keep up with her .
i went looking for you . i went straight to the bookstore , ' cause that's where you were last time , but you weren't there . how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened ? you didn't tell me how to do that , did you ? i knew i was under surveillance , so when i couldn't spot anybody , i started yelling .
if you kill tonight and i'm in jail the police will know i'm innocent .
you're firing me .
what was i ? your idea of a fuckin ' hors d'oeuvre ? huh ?
what if he's on the level ?
that's got her . thanks . i'm steve christy . welcome to camp crystal lake . you got some grubby clothes ? climb into ' em . alice , see if bill has cleaned out the boathouse . i want him to start with the canoes . what happened to brenda ?
i'm not sure .
yes . he seeks a levy of troops and money .
i see bud because i want to . i see bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him .
couldn't have said it better myself . now all this - - - - west of the fault is the most expensive real estate in the world . los angeles . san diego . san francisco . and here - - - - is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land . land that happens to be owned by lex luthor enterprises . well ...  ... call me a fool , but ... it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point - - - - that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the san andreas fault to ' do its thing . ' ah , it would've been so nice , y'know ...
they're big details , jerry .
no . i can't . not yet .
to do what ... ? to do what , for chrissake ... ? to help her to do what ? she's dead ...
" my dear " ...

a little respect would be nice , that's all .
tough break .
you could say that .

did you send this ? is it a joke ?
some other time , george .
i don't know .
why did she say she was leaving ?
yeah .
well , like what did he ask , exactly ?
i'm not heartless , ma'am . i have every sympathy for you and for the little girl , but if i were to consent to every operation brought to me , i'd have no time for teaching - - and that's a great responsibility upon me , ma'am - - a great responsibility .
yes . there have been men who kill for pleasure - - strange pleasure . there was blue beard in france - - jack the ripper in london . it's not uncommon .
go on , hit me .

the princess of darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain . yet i am inclined for one as lovely as you , to be more lenient . i have but to touch you with my finger , and it would mean the end of you , all over , quickly and painlessly ...

jasmine ... do you have yesterday's show on tape , by any chance ?
do i look like that kinda girl ? i lost my room this morning . i don't know where i'm gonna sleep tonight , but i keep going . what the hell else can i do ? i've still got my figure , and like this bozo said , as long as there's a sidewalk , i'll always have a job .

that's what he wants .
i've had time to get over it .
i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that . i mean , i don't mean i'm happy you're uncomfortable , but , yknow ... i'm such a loser . every time i come to a party i tell myself i'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod .
she's very beautiful . she's much younger than i am . and she's rich , i hope .

sir ! no sir !
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time ?
he's fragile , man ! he's very fragile !

you're an hour and a half late .
no , you gave a very convincing performance . and you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse .
it's a simple thing . everybody gets them . all we gotta do is call an exterminator .
- - then perhaps , the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld .
well , almost ... unfortunately i do have to punch in by 5.00 every day .

i don't , but i'm pretty sure . it's a long story but i cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe . if they start a trace it will be to a pic'n'save on pico .
and what happens when all hell breaks loose ?
guess he took off ... you have his keys , right ?
you will not carry any other pagers with you . you will not carry anything , for that matter , that i have not just given you .

it's for assholes . the legal buck blows , memphis . you know that . doing this , we make mad bank , my boys are down , the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze . yeah , sure , you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never , never-ever , having to say " paper or plastic ? "
okay , sammy .
check the permits . it was built as a guesthouse . it's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when south laguna was incorporated .

then it's time to change that - -
see them two big trees across there ?
come and get him .
i'm not good enough for her to associate with , am i ? i'm not good enough to even talk about her , am i ?
the ring up to him ) what's a mourning ring ?
i have no idea what you're talking about .
no . i'm not busy .
no .
are you wearing eye shadow ?
and if he doesn't make it - - ?
what's it to ya ?
that's butterfield ...
i'd like to hear them .
before rafe left , he asked me to be the one to tell you , if it happened .
captain = 8a
well , it isn't .
that was seven hundred years ago .
why ? !
when ?
dr . maxwell has very unpleasant news for us .
you mean until you showed up ?
i hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it .
look , snoop , i don't know what glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get , but the deal is me and buddy get half of whatever we take from ripley , understand ? how you and glenn cut up the rest is up to you .
[ do you know who i am ? ]
what happened to marcus , sallah ?
... a fine boy from sicily , captured by the american army , and sent to new jersey as a prisoner of war ...
we must do something .
i thought people got all that stuff at baby showers . when my stepmom had my sister i remember she got about a million presents . they were all lame though , so i wasn't jealous .
granted , the free huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left ...
ow , harold - - mom said not the head .
hey , it's legit . strictly dinner and dance .
though i guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband .
not if i have anything to say about it .
baby ...
jesus ...
he was a sorry sonofabitch , and i'm sorry i ever married him .
this one .
a cat . we found a litter box downstairs but not the cat . neighbors are watching for it .
you're right , i probably just misfiled ...
that's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty .
no ... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet . something about a matching serial number that got burned . but i had to sign a form saying i wouldn't talk to anyone about it .
how did doctor almack react to that ?
i believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution . i don't know what the heck they do with ' em . maybe they use them for dust rags , or pen wipers ...
the least you could do is nod and act sympathetic - -
i need to confess .
thanks .
no , mr . lounds . you'll be just fine .
that's what he did to me . he put cigarettes out on me .
and if i told you that you already knew all that shit , and that you had them killed , what would you do then ?
i'll be around and back in town in a few days - -
i need a drink , that's all .
the stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing ...
i discovered this . sec filing ... for the sale of the cbs corporation to westinghouse corporation .
you have to ...
yeah , that would be a good move .
hey ! stop it ! i can't see .
well , she ... uh ...
that was different .
what right do you have to take me for granted ?
but , i have no experience .
i'm not a gladiator . i refuse to fight .
it gets worse - - you still have your freshman yearbook ?
don't worry . i'll have a cool scar .
oh , i put a few games on for your daughter . i hope you don't mind .
a coup d'etat ! of course , that was foreseen by lenin himself !
i'm going to the store .
you first , edvard .
sir , heat shields at maximum !
okay , so they were in your wallet , and you left your wallet somewhere . some bar . christine'll understand .
we oughtn't be reading his nasty stories - -
care for a hot dog ?
i love the symphony .
and the lord told that man - -
... whaddo i do ?
let's have a look anyway .
the following morning . sunday .
you and i know about this - - and that's where it stops . understand ? it never happened .
it's been three .
we have to try it . we can't stay here . melanie needs help . mother , the house won't take another attack .
ray ! where are you ? are you all right ?
lonesome ?
you can do anything you want . you're his sister .
" the day after yesterday . "
i stand for something . and i'm trying to communicate something .
almost .
you guys were arrested this morning , but none of you have last night's clothes . <u> you </u> were seen burning them . add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good .
i respect life , don't you see ? for each and every human life i have respect .
hardly .
well , i ...
fire the whole division . we're moving more of the operations division into manhattan anyway . whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed . we already have all the key people here . anyone else is expendable .
hey there .
she did ?
rufus , play it back ...
every american should see the grand canyon . are you an american ?
i'm a lot better off than i was an hour ago .
well , we'll do that this weekend .
that's not fair . you're taking all the fun out of it .
why have i come to a church ? i never have before . i guess i just ... felt i should .
you wanna take it out of your wallet , please ?
only a fully trained jedi knight , with the force as his ally , will conquer vader and his emperor . if you end your training now , if you choose the quick and easy path ... as vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate , despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now .
you may not believe this ... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god . to believe that we're all here for a purpose , that all this ... means something . but it's because that part of me wants it so badly that i'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion . of course i want to know god if there is one ... but it has to be real . unless i have proof how can i be sure ?
murdered ! by whom ?
oh - uh - nothing .
i'd better get you down .
zowie .
c . d . s . the music kind . from the grendel label .
how ?
i just caught the end .
i get a lot of calls . most of them are from people who say they know things .
just hold up a second , captain - - i'll get to you soon enough - - we've got things to do here .
- - understand what you're asking for here . the massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason , both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in , and earned during . no one can profit from the marriage . the pre-nup protects the wealthier party .
scarred for life , that's how i am !
in the navy , we used to call guys - -
that one ?
you damn well thought wrong .
hey , mr . arky , gimme a break ! i'm seventeen years old ! i'm not responsible for all these problems !
would i hire you ?
gobble , gobble , gobble .
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england ?
the gun ...
yeah . sure , i'm crazy in love with him , who wouldn't be ...
it's what we're here for , ain't it ?
still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command . they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed .
i could go to a movie thursday night . ' cause we don't have school on friday .
what do you mean ? what's going on ?
i know that niche .
thank you .
tch ... how romantic . yeah . if i wasn't already committed to lydia , boy . except anne'd never go for me though . she loves you too much . and you really love her , huh ?
nonsense !
fuck you .
surely you can't be serious .
you'd better call and cancel .
gonna try .
sister paul was in her eighties ? did she climb up here often ?
you made me have an abortion .
gerron out of it , you're only jealous ' cause you're old .
yes . how do you know ?
how wonderful of you , to hold that information in your <u> busy </u> mind ...
i'd like to , but ...
do you want to take a session ?
sorry , i - -
why ?
why do you always answer a question with a question ?
no - - the rent in paid . the lady asked us to promise , i wouldn't open the door .
i don't know if i can say that .
everything is not fine !
norma , grow up . you're a woman of fifty . there's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five .
will you shut up ? you sound like my fucking sister .
i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time . we've just received word that dr . evil , the ultimate square , is planning to take over the world .
don't hold back on us , max . we need all the help we can get .
i just put jim into black creek ... are you acquainted with ...
then let me run the show , general lee .
oh . what were you doing , then , that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian ...
thought what ?
i'd be glad to . not now , of course - - with you alone .
rake her .
it's not quite the same thing .
yes . yes , justin , we heard it .
well , i'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you .
a gift . when you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt .
you and your friend .
what ?
wherever you go on the planet , i'll find you . there's no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
that's right . your meal ticket's flown the coop . that blue bastard has apparently left the planet .
but these are white people , anybody . the punch ...
how about what ?
i'm sorry . i thought i was to be the light . but why do i confuse you ? am i so strange ?
nah , not now - - all those hard-ons around . i'll wait . not now .
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem : ' press the button , pull the chain , out comes a chocolate choo-choo train . '
you know , blonde , thin , whatever ...
is this something you're interested in ? i'm not really that person i was .
no .
i haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me . not that i care - - but where is your husband ?
uh-huh .
do you think you won ?
he's in the bathroom .
you don't like it , do you ?
why would i do that ?
you're beginning to sound like mr . kirkeby already .
i wanted to tell you alone ; your wife doesn't know what's going on .
if you want caitlin , then face veronica , tell her , and be with caitlin . if you want veronica , be with veronica . but don't pine for one and fuck the other . man , if you weren't such a fucking coward ...
how long can you keep lecktor out without him getting suspicious ?
i didn't say it bothered me .
the phone . what did you hear on the phone . tell me . word for word .
it's a civilian facility .
i gotta have ruben , and a ...
bring him over sometime . i have some other stuff to show him .
you got no idea ...
whattaya think you're in now ?
that's not a laugh ! i mean a laugh from the heart . now let's see . i'm going to tell you a funny story . just a moment ... i've got it ! well , it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america ...
what do you suppose anybody wants ? money , money , money !
are they out now ?
a lot that means .
a coup d'etat ?
call jane for me . she's at the little thai place .
this night , this reunion will be an important step in our relationship .
hardly buried . earning interest , love . earning interest in an offshore account . tidy little premium per annum , that .
keep him talking .
what about relatives ?
put in the coordinates and let's get a visual . the visuals aren't coming up .
do you know where i can steal some ?
do you like poetry , raymond ?
no , the reason i ask is - -
so whaddya think ?
i suppose you want me to fix that up for you too , eh ?
maybe not , ... but you let him believe it ! and then i gotta explain about the homeless ...
don't be ridiculous .
the whole facility was shut down in the forties , wasn't it ? some kind of scandal ...
no . even if i could give up my friends , i could never give up my son .
careful of that edging there ...
well , why not say the least and get it over with ?
i need you to seduce our young cecile . introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery .
c'mon , are you or aren't you ?
you're like a kid , you're coming in here like it's saturday night , you want me to say that you've got a fever - - you don't have to go to school ...
that was al on the phone . he wants me to meet him out at the fawcett place . says some detectives from santa rosa'll be there in a little while . will you be all right here ?
mmm . why don't you go away for a while ?
monster . there never was a structure change . this place was built the same from day one .
253 ... 254 ... 255 . i get the same as you jim . looks like paul's our president .
they have done ... nothing ... they are my people ...
what do you mean ?
how do we seem to you ? do you think us beautiful , magical , our white skin , our fierce eyes ? drink , you ask me ! have you any idea of the thing you will become ?
oh , i didn't know that .
i guess you could say i wasn't thinkin ' , captain .
it's no use . she just isn't here .
hey , what more could i want ? i survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride , and neither of us is dead . i'd say i feel almost as great as you look .
i bade her come . god forbid ! juliet ! juliet ! juliet !
people are going to know who's responsible . and they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly . and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news .
... yer ducts .
there's still time to undo this .
work ! don't say that word , man .
no ...  ... i don't get this place . they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress . i don't get it .
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit , cuts his fingertip , takes my hand , does the same to me ...
sulu !
married ?
about us .
thanks very much sam .
midnight ! mon dieu ! driving the youngsters hard , eh ?
i want my father back , you son - ofa-bitch !
and so i always manage to , do you see ? like the book / script thing , do you see ?
just give reed a little more time . you know how he works - - analyzing every little step before he takes one - -
if i could have a little more room .
can i say something in my defense ?
what's your name , giant ?
watch out sid . randy said the killer's always superhuman .
you couldn't handle shit . you just better come through with some kind of payment on tuesday ... anything . understand ? hold onto your pay - check this week .
ah , james . you always were a cunning linguist ... au revoir , mon cher .
what is your location ?
i'm selling this place . i want out of this hell hole !
emergency override !
but you're a friend of jimmy's . i think of you as a brother already .
some people do it for for their lovers
that's very thoughtful , honey . it's just a slump . things will pick up .
tonight .
coach knows what abs are ?
i know you do , darling .
junot ?
i'm so happy you like it . i'm so relieved you said yes , and i'm really , um , what , thrilled , yes actually , to finally meet you .
it seems like ever since i found out about this guy , this name , i've been kind of crazy . like i was on drugs or something .
oh , what do you do with that ?
it's fine by me , jesse .
go ahead . jump right on into my nightmare . the water's warm . _ 65 .
yes .
ten minutes for ten dollars .
" oh , laura ... "
you what ? to save me ?
what ? what is that ?
you have not slept in two days .
well , we gotta one hundred thousand men .
i'll lick the stamps .
why do i have to keep looking at you ?
i allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with .
i didn't follow you .
i've got a present . shut your eyes . keep ' em closed . i know you're going to love them .
the extortion , the threats ...
who did it ?
you bet . hang on ...
stop being such a bitch , sal .
i don't think that's necessary .
oh yes . mrs . shumann called about you .
perhaps - - but tell me you promise , anyway .
i wasn't eavesdropping , i was overhearing .
i'm so sorry .
nah .
look , look , i'm not joking around now , okay ? come on , let's go , let's go !
open that door , you'll see . your brother's there ... conrad . he's there . it's your birthday party ...
you mean our past as in me and sid . this has nothing to do with you gale .
no ? was mozart a good man ?
i didn't find what i was looking for .
hi .
tell me about kip -
the beach ?
dickless . if they took care of * business , i'd be out of business , know what i mean ?
` dave ' ?
maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching .
well , at least i fell for him before i found out he was rich ! that's new . wait a minute ! he said today he knew where home was . what happened this morning ? ! where did you go ? !
i want amphetamines .
very professional .
i don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown .
shall we go inside ? i should so like to show you some of our rare treasures .
i heard what you did . thank you .
yeah ?
we've got weather moving in from the west .
you were out at sea ! hey , guess what ? i graduated . i got my degree .
... you can leave whenever you want . i don't refrain you .
whatever you say , man . look ... can we talk about this ?
sorry , cooch . i lost eagle bear - -
you had to deal with him in running the club .
no , luis . it's not me . you're mistaken .
we have a man down ...
because i'm all you've got .
pretty straightforward , but i don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer - -
... as long as they're ready for the opening i don't care , just tell them that .
why can't we pick up his signal ?
there's no * real * ship as can match the interceptor .
oh , come on - come on ! we'll soon find the wizard !
yeah , your fee . i had to figure that out , since there wasn't no note .
whats the date ?
yeah , but i hear she gives a mean blow job .
and if you can't deliver them ?
i know the feeling . this must be hell . can you believe , a flucking sorority ... i'm gonna vomit day-glo .
i don't get it .
i'm going to have a home . not just a house i'm afraid to stay in ... and a man to go with it . i'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be ... remember , karen ?
those aren't real memories . no one has that kind of recall .
shut the fuck up , would you ?
wait ! i'll talk to him .
where are we going , merle ? are we going home ?
helen - - the killer directly contacted you . his interest in you is <u> intense </u> . i'm worried about you . i don't want to lose you . i know this stirs up every monster under the bed , but this is the only direct contact we have with him . the only chance we have to trap him . so , you can turn internet back on , or i do , and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick , scream and hyperventilate .
why do i have to do this ?
yes , sir . it's true .
well ... ' bye .
30 continued :
okay , sister , you get your job back .
about hippolyte charles .
tonight's the night ?
thank goodness . breaktime .
where is he ?
surprise , surprise .
no i'm not .
you keep saying that .
thank you , madame de beauharnais . you probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago , at a party at paul's house .
can i just say , i thought ' ghost ' was a wonderful film .
i'm sorry . i didn't come here to blame you .
my name is sidney winch , and -
i wanted to be a good one .
i'll take that as a no .
you can't win ' em all .
father said witches live there .
it's one of jack's favorites .
he means our chances of getting home are not very good . you might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong .
what do you mean ? would you rather have terrorists ?
please don't worry , your majesty . leave the worrying to me . as you know , i'm not an ant of half - measures . i don't pussyfoot around . this crisis is my number one priority , and i promise you it's being dealt with swiftly , and decisively .
the plot thickens . it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher .
no ...
how'd you do it , old man ?
bye .
not yet ... i'm waiting for the right moment .
cole and munoz . i'm uh ... letting them run with the ball for a while .
give me some credit . i got you this far , let's go to the grand jury . this is never going to stop if we -
do you think i'm ready for it ? ! i hate this shit . i'm not a fucking martyr ! i hate every goddamn part of it !
what this ?
well , i'm a writer , actually .
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change .
yes , yes , everything . there were over fifty people employed by the white house and creep to ratfuck - - some of what they did is beyond belief .
i don't wanna come along with you .
well , i try and talk to him , but mostly he's the one who does the talking .
thanks .
stop it !
you'll need more than bird droppings for blackheart .
- - barry , if i were to say to you i haven't seen evil dead ii yet , what would that mean ?
it's artificial ?
it's okay with arnie ... come on , let's go .
who me ?
yes ...
i mean , we get paid tonight , don't we ?
words can hurt very much .
that's why i never checked it . the bag felt right .
out . it's the way out . so just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it .
... it raises a very serious question : <u> what happens if jerry </u> <u> gets mad </u> ?
the core ... !
no , no . he's our only " star " right now . he'd go crying straight to the press . he'd crucify us - - the sonofabitch ! get someone from our staff on his ass . tap his phones . i want to know everyone he talks to .
you want to talk ? come on , jack ... did i cross the line by mentioning the future or what ?
oh , my gosh , everything ! my trip out here , what we've both been doing , you know ...
thats the beauty . an anonymous call . makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to , eh , french-fuck ?
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined .
no , i'm dumber than a goddamn slug . now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado ?
thanks ... partner .
yes , max , i understand .
about what ?
granted , the cops are not an alternative . certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk .
hey , you know me .
and see when i get out of here . i've got plans . going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand , where women really know how to treat a guy . see , out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket . no fucking problem .
c'mon , larry . be good for you .
i don't know , and i wasn't about to mess with it .
merely for our records , miss mayfield . it's usual for the guests who come here for the first time .
... why ?
you do ?
there has to be something that we can do .
you want me to just hang - - ?
the brass is afraid of sabotage . this makes ' em easier to protect - - and easier to service .
maybe that makes a nice excuse .
we're not dropping it . now that's the reason , isn't it ? i'm a dirty degenerate , aren't i ? i'm not fit to - -
i should get a garter belt .
we run they'll shoot us anyway . if we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; iraqis . or even if they know we're americans they might get scared , think we're part of a detachment and keep on going .
is that what you think ?
and just this year , " brian's sound spectrum " . your own company even . big step .
besides , if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done .
i'll just hang then , shall i ?
right , his leg's going now .
jesus christ , no . okay , okay . you got it , you got it ! you're the boss .
you know what i mean - - the envelope with the stamps . i want it .
what do i say ?
it's just carpet .
it must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden .
i loved him . i hurt .
i was an experiment . just to see if i could do it .
i have faced him . have you ?
patrick ? i can't hear you .
you're livin ' in edina , then ?
this watch is the nicest watch i ever had .
they came from ostrov in eastern poland .
if you really mean it , i will .
make it twenty .
i think new york was just what i needed . so many people . i never feel alone .
you'd probably tell me .
when my money moves , i go with it .
i don't ... yes . okay , the board .
and i don't need to know . so fuck you , i'm goin ' to hollywood .
no - - the only thing i did for him was to keep track of the man named worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight .
you smiled at me .
pretty good , huh ? i taught them everything they do .
dell - - show me that on a screen .
there won't be any this week .
i can't identify him ..
how many of those drinks did you have ?
yeah ?
he's shut out the communication circuit !
then i'll see you later .
that ? i hear a mob : unemployed , drunkards , vagabonds ... the world's dregs .
jake , c'mon now . don't start .
what's compassion , mister .
no , but you stole from them .
oh , hey , that's great , i think i see an old war buddy over there , it's been fun chatting . good luck with the hallucinations .
yes .
the difference being what - - that i refuse to adopt the standard line , that i don't care about the results of my work ? well , i do care . of course any discovery has to be verifiable , of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method , but i refuse to go around pretending i'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain i'm just not .
i'm sorry , louise . i know you're all upset . it's just i'm so excited to be out of the house , i guess . i wonder if darryl's home yet .
well , maybe he's still the vice - president . now if i were to offer you - -
is the war worth it ? is it worth a one-term presidency ? because i think right now that's what we're looking at .
jeffrey , how are you ? how's the family , okay ?
mrs . ansel's clothing .
it can louse up your insides . you can get puh , puh , puh ...
i'm not taking him with me .
you're not what ? qualified for anything else ?
you sure you want to throw that card ?
oh no . do you ?
are you here to take shelly back ?
the contracts ? that's the easy part . finding the money to buy the company , that's hard .
oh . it's an incredibly disgusting , and not remotely sexy thing , that they described in a movie i'd never let you go to . but it's real . does he have an older brother ?
yo ! your spitting rice all over us ! god .
kristen ...
just smack her now .
you know , something always bothered me about that from day one , and i can't put my finger on it .
did he say anything about my sister ?
it's no good going berserk against a dragon !
yeah .
sure you can ! you may even like it ... it's a killer rush . you'll see . hey , don't i show you things , johnny u ?
so , you live around here .
do you think i simulated what happened between us ?
uh ... oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett's apartment building ... and they're most unusual .
like i told to the washington boys , bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his marine discharge ...
don't ask any questions--just give it to me .
it could've happened to anyone .
look at the tiny figures .
it's not west , is it ? tell me it's not west .
half what you owed me . i am still due for one gentleman of verona .
is it a problem for you to ask ?
oh , rosie .
thank you .
are you ... okay ?
but vince has contacts all over the place ! this is san francisco ! they'll be looking for me !
you'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me . anyway , i have to go . i promised melinda i'd help her with her oral .
no .
lainey , there's no evidence that simone isn't real .
i asked first .
no shit .
anybody here wanna double their bet ?
yup , a benthic petroleum paid for it . so as long as they're hold the pink slip , i go where they tell me .
life is only life when it is bounded by death . the inheritance is death . the gift is the finality of life . to be part of the fabric . the inside . i love you brenna .
yeah , whoops i came .
so it's all worked out perfectly ...
sir ?
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper .
i've been thinking about that , about you and karen .
you're not wimping out on us , goodspeed .
they're probably foreigners with ways different from our own . - they may do some more folk dancing .
anybody have a cigarette ? but seriously , do me a favor and concorde me back to prison . i don't care anymore . i hope you have the receipts for the threads .
listen to me , grady , this is serious . something really weird is happening . it started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad .
it will be okay if i sleep . i need to lie down and sleep .
oh shit ... oh shit ...
be careful , conner .
okay , lovey .
you can have it for good . it is my wedding present .
maternity ward , huhh !
not if my tron program was running . that would seal the system off . if your file's in there ...
the door was unlocked .
she's murdered her hair ... you do something with her , i'm never going to touch her again .
oh , i think he's a wonderful man . make a great , great president .
is my family here yet ?
color me impressed . i thought you grew out of betty finn .
hey , uh , mister ? hey , okay if i grab a cue ?
but he isn't a menace ! he told me what he came here for .
no , i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge .
listen--i took a steak out of the freezer . i thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us , what do you say ?
the case !
with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old ! plus , i'm popular ... you want to be popular ... i can recognize a cry for help when i see one .
billie . you ready ?
maybe later .
i know this .
i found out about this captain mccluskey who broke mike's jaw . he's definitely on sollozzo's payroll , and for big money . mccluskey's agreed to be the turk's bodyguard . what you have to understand is that while sollozzo is guarded like this , he's invulnerable . nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain . never . it would be disastrous . all the five families would come after you sonny ; the corleone family would be outcasts ; even the old man's political protection would run for cover . so just ... take that into consideration .
oh my gosh , bud ...
yeah ? you like ?
you know my friend maureen ? her son , the investment banker ? he paid for her entire retirement in boca raton . what a mench he is . instead of schleping to save hanukkah , god forbid you should go back to business school and get an mba . maybe then you could send me to boca , too .
and the kid who wrote skywire - - then gave it away ? they're calling him the digital robin hood .
i'd rather not talk about it . i'll tell you about it sometime .
what ?
i don't want to hear that word !
i thought it was okay where it was .
fine . i'll check out in the morning .
yes . short notice you know , but i think there's nice closure to it . hello judge muson . a pleasure as always .
you must be edward bloom .
mother's not half so blind as you .

this weekend .
i can't remember . i've got to make some money .
that's just lovely .

bully for you .
god , i don't think so . better look in the house .

i know what i'm doing , so either lend a hand or go back to bed !
ethan , you an ' martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts - - without pay ... charlie , hightail it to head - quarters an ' spread the word ...

she will not be murdered . on the day of the wedding , i want the thieves ' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested .
i'm sorry , rob , that's , it's - -
god . you would . come on , bruce . i just want to get two drinks in you . as an experiment .
no .

tell me . what do you want ?
that's what i was sent down for . i'm your guardian angel .
- - don't tell me where you're going .
eric !
there's another pass on the photo . we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up , and it should get us back down .

how can we be happy ?
childs , where's that magneto from chopper one ?
i don't have to look at anything . i don't have - -
shift to your left .

the movies are a good second date , you know , as a date ?
we better watch him . he's crazy .
of <u> course </u> we weren't scared . just a little startled . one of those sushi dropped down my kamali .
what is it but traveling from one place to another , taking pictures ? it's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation .
a synthetic opium analogue .
we shouldn't even really be doing this .
no .
liar !
i'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book . i'd be announcing myself as the killer . i'm not stupid .
what did he say to you in french ?
could you believe that fire ? man ! first day ! there i was , adcox and me , pullin ' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin ' throat ! i love it here - - no surround and drown for this company . fighting 17th ! goddamn stephen's amazing . you see how he took that fire by the balls ? i'm gonna be that good some day , you watch .
don't look so shocked , it's been a long time . i bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years , haven't you ?
all right . you won't know what to look for at first , scottie . even i , who know her so well , cannot tell , sometimes , when the change has begun . she looks so lovely and normal ...
no ...
i won't .
... he stuck a fishhook in it .
gear . you know , clothing .
i saw it . gee , look at that thing swing , will you ? do you think it never stops ?
sure , chief . i think i'll grab one for myself while i'm at it ...
i'm afraid you'll hurt him .
beam him out !
addison , just a few minutes ago . when i told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything i wanted -
mr . parkins , what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady ?
i . sold the car .
i need a favor .
i want him here . sit down !
you're not gonna chicken out on me now , are you ? we've got your kiss song playing and everything .
it floated back up . i had to take him out and - -
i can accept that .

yeah .

i don't ... i ... i can't remember ...
you don't like me ? you hate me ?
oh , let's not talk about it .
i want you to reach fredo . i know he's scared , but have one of our people reach him . assure him that there will be no reprisals . tell him that i know roth misled him .
oh ... mr . gardiner ... mr . chauncey gardiner ... you're not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you ?
well , that was a monumental waste of time ! i pay good money , only to be taken on some wild goose chase ! i made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator !
what's the matter with you ?
roma , would you , i'd like to get some lunch ...
well , you'd be working on the cutting edge . you'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it . super string theory , chaos math , advanced algorithms - -
bullshit . that boat hasn't made steam for fifty years . we found her . she's ours .
so how many miles do you think it is ?

it is nine p . m . pleasant dreams .

i knew he wouldn't want to speak to me . that dick .
i know a couple of addicts . stupid wee lassies . i feed them what they need . a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull . it's easy money for me . not exactly a fortune , but i'm thinking , ' i should be coining it here . ' less whores , more skag . swanney's right . get clean , get into dealing , that's where the future lies . set up some contacts , get a good load of skag , punt it , profit . what do you think ?
he likes to play the great man .
when do you need it ?
i know . i know . it's bad . i'm a bad person . but i try not to be , terri . i really do . and i really miss you .
bob ...

barks at han .
my name is chance .
... he wasn't listening to the right thing ...
oh my god , angie crick ? from english class ?
" you're playing a dangerous game here . if you're trying to blackmail me ... it's not going to work . "
what happened ?
follow the richwhiteman ...
that's because it was a challenge . you has control over you're situation . it was hard , but you rose to it .
pretty close ?
i won't pay for nothing .
of course you are . you couldn't do those terrible things . come home with me - maybe things will make sense then ...
... and you know how many times he done been shot ? seven times ! seven .

so you're buzz's boy . i've been expecting you . you hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner .
mr . soze will be most -
let's try and get these ropes loose . we've got to get to marcus before the nazis do !

stanley moss , ladeesngennlmen ... and she says ...
hey guess what ? we're going to the carnival tonight , be ready to go in 10 minutes .
so , captain hawk , in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou . in the autre , you got lead that won't get you gelato .
yes , because someone was always keeping me awake . ever since i was little . that was my job . i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long , and she woke up all the time . and after she died , well , it's been a few months , but i still , i still wake up , it's ... a habit . i know we've only known each other a couple of hours , but i'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this . i'm really happy to be here with you .
that's fucked it . what do we do now ? no money , no weed ; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses .
try an ' tell ' em , tom . they'll get two an ' a half , jus ' the minute we're gone . an ' you know what that is ? that's one ton a peaches picked an ' carried for a dollar . that way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive ! tell ' em to come out with us , tom ! them peaches is * ripe * . two days out an ' they'll pay * all * of us five !

i'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway . believe me , i'd prefer not to . i may be synthetic but i'm not stupid .
yes , ma'am . four long , hard weeks of sacrifice for my country ... for my people ... for you . but i survived .
iraqi's won't buy it . either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying .
still , please .
she was torn apart ! she died of a broken heart .
catholic girls are scary ...
yeah , i guess .
how long has he been in there ?
you must hate it .
yes .
i want to introduce a couple of people . doc white is a flight surgeon ; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission , because we can't spare the weight of an extra man .
i will alert the chinese delegation . you know , i would never have let you go alone , kundun .
what a fine meal you'd make , be the rest of you sweet as your tongue .
ten years , i think . what i miss ?
yes , one and a half please .
quitting ? i'm not thinking about quitting .
yeah , but it didn't go so good . he wasn't the man i thought he'd be . theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup , but his hands are trembling , spilling some of the coffee .
he's expecting my call . i'm going to the station ... and i'm going to call him .
hey wizard .
i know it's not . i'll tell you , you got , you know , you got ... what did i learn as a kid on western ? don't sell a guy one car . sell him five cars over fifteen years .
i don't believe you .
must have missed the sign .
and you should . your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl , and your daddy is so pleased with you .
now in haskins vs . haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother , thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby .
speck . harold speck .
he's my contact for chrissake ! there's two crates . can you get me into the hospital ?

you nasty , sardonic - -
we've got ten triacs before we're toast ! !
i'm getting angry .
i'm standing right here .
a flack jacket .
mr . sheldrake , i don't want you to think i thought this was going to win any academy award .
don't let me fall !
no shit ? dick , that's great !
have i ever let you down before - - ?
i told the d . a . everything i know .
read the newspapers .
cool , huh huh .
okay ... would you rather ... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super-model for a month , or make love to a otter on crank for a week ?
just one question . did you calculate the risk ?
i wouldn't mind being famous .
give it some time , ellen ... see what happens .
oh jeez .
what , nervous i'm going to win ?
well , why not ?
you think i'm ronnie's spy or somethin ' ? come tomorrow that dumb - ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin ' to keep his head on his shoulders . you think he's gonna be thinkin ' about you ?

that's good money .
the final signature is approx - imately 300 meters up that incline .
i'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall , while you push from out here . maybe that'll do it .
it's what i deserve .
i just told you .
are all jews the same ?
those are all from the fair last year . abbott and me were judges at the pet show .

i see , a flying carpet , huh ? i don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job , would you ?
he said he'll pick it up in a couple of days .
uh , victor , i hope i haven't done something to make you think ...
okay , artoo , let him have it . now get out of here , little fellow , we've got things to do .
okay .
and how does one do that ?
you're a liar .
shit ! this is too much ! chief , i tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an ' make it all the way to canada before they know what bit ' em .
uh , i don't want to bet it all .
we'll all have dinner . i'll fix your favorite .
then there it is . ashby gets the itch .
i'll think of something , don't worry .
you think he's for real ?
give me the stones !
royalty do not help people with their luggage .
is it me , or are you this nervous around all women ?
cone .
no .
okay .
ah , yes . well , charmed , i'm sure . so , princess , have you ever danced with a hero ?
yeah , that's fascinating , but i'm just a fat , dumb cop lookin ' for a psycho killer - -
guess that's what they call alaskan hospitality .
the one with the horses .
i never got to know him , really . i couldn't speak japanese , and his english was terrible . but i couldn't say anything , because his english was better than my japanese .
why not ?
miss connell's testimony will be very important .
some people do it on the pavement
all i can tell you sam , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay ...
over here !
look . do we have a problem here ? there's no reason to have a problem . i'm gonna make you feel real good . you wanna czech girl ? after i'm done with you , you won't miss her . now why don't you pay me ?
projections were far too optimistic .
may i speak to you for a moment ?
i thought i should check our emergency transmitters .
it's not like saying that at all , actually , rob . art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records - -
a wallet . a hotel room card . some cash .
i don't dance .
margo . margo's great . she knows it . that's the trouble . she can play peck's bad boy all she wants , and who's to stop her ? who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves ?
to yourself ...
you might be the only one with a job .
there's no hatch . there's no hatch !
i just wanted to say , au revoir and thank you for your help , my friend .
for the car , for aiding and abetting a prison escape , and conspiring to do whatever you came here for .
i'm going to try and locate redbeard - i assume you've heard of him .
it's jerry's worst idea .
leave it - - i'll wash it for you .
he's probably outside . you know how he is . gets bored ...
hey , hey ! the fuck you doing ? !
that's what makes it so good . you wanta hear what i saw today ?
that's easy . there was . he's dead .
but we do have a choice . to make it better . instead of worse .
well .
then you would use your - -
no . not yet .
what the hell for ?
nah , that's just tony's way of telling me judge judy starts in ten minutes . you ever watch it ?
but , erik ...
jon , i'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun .
uh . well . maybe you could give polo a hand going in ...
shut up and drive !
why would she want me to think you were on ice ?
you've missed this bit .
no , harry , i can't - -
in the war . europe , i believe . they could hardly send him to the pacific , could they ?
i'd say at least eighteen hours .
see ya , kate .
mr . rabin has no right to - -
many things ...
ah , begging your pardon , but shouldn't we be going ?
no , that's all right , i don't mind . i came up here for two reasons . to begin with , i was bored with my job in san francisco . i was teaching at a private school there ... well , you know , you probably went to one yourself .
it doesn't matter . it's too late for all of us .
honest ?
right , all the bullets we can eat .
marty , i don't want you hang arounna house tonight . i want you to go take a shave and go out and dance .
merrick ...
yo , you gotta show some patience . you want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation . son , there is no such thing .
are you the one who left that note ?
ask if anyone has anything in cargo ! anything to drink !
i've been looking for this jake vig for some time now . problem is , the guy's the invisible man . a spook , a spectre , a ghost . then , like a gift , jake's good buddy and member of his crew , alfonse moorely , is found the other day with a hole in his head .
that's where we're going .
absolutely !
yeah , well ...
tuttle ! are you from central services ?
where you coming from ?
this one's different . no one can trace it . it's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger ... infecting other computer systems like a virus .
don't say my name ...
one-hundred-thirteen degrees . that was back in july of forty-seven . now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that .
yes , sir .
don't tell me what to do .
thank you very much .
what ?
maybe i dont .
do you have a pair that are just friendly ?
where's turley ?
i just tested for one ...
yeah , that's dr . st . luc . he's the head of our little medical clinic here .
think so ? you don't know ? didn't you write it down ?
why ? you were so pleased with him .
yours will do !
frank ... what's wrong ?
i don't know . i want him to lock me up .
yeah , we really had our work cut out for us . it really is the curse of the sequel . the billy / stu things been done .
no , thanks--i never gambled in my life .
are you alright ?
it was just a can of beer , frank .
we're going to figure this out . get a grip on yourself .
i'll tell you what . when i get my engineering degree and i'm swimming in my swimming pool , it will be very fucking okay .
you're all safe . thanks be to god !
must you take those ?
you borrowed money from your mother ?
that was weird . i guess leaving was the best idea .
you're a police officer . you have so much , so many good things and you seem so together ... so all straight and put together without problems .
of course you took the initiative .
this is a very interesting cafe . i congratulate you .
i don't know . i'm completely in the dark here . that's what i get for moving away .
why does he trust you ?
think of it as special assignment , mrs . peel . with a twist . you're our chief suspect .
try again .
who am i ?
yes .
kind that will help you find the answers , george .
doesnit sleep ?
not a chance .
i wish they were vampires so i could nuke them in their hearts .
it was fun , wasn't it ?
there was no card .
not much . we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage .
that would be beaumont livingston .
little black party dresses ?
she's not here .
forget it .
how much time does he have left ?
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow . just the two of us . or just the one of us .
you can't work if you can't think . you get in bed . it's all right . i'll stay here with you . it's all right . come on ...
yes ! i'll help you all you need ! i hate dope !
he did have pointed ears .
shit , i ain't interested in puttin ' my hands on you . that does nothin ' for me . no . i don't need to be pattin ' no ass . all i'm sayin ' is , how do i know you're not a cop ?
oh man , you a fine nigga ! you know that ?
take it easy .
you're gonna be okay , aren't you , daddy ?
then , take blood parasites . it's yours . now we each have three .
i don't really have any problems .
genesis ? ! whatever for ?
oh no . you're not like me . in fact , i'm betting you're the same greedy , remorseless , egomaniacal bad guy you always were .
we're late to get to your mother .
i can get power to this module and sub-bay if i remote these busses . i've gotta get past the mains , which are a total melt-down .
yesterday morning , you passed a stopped school bus , which was flashing its lights , then you - -
he ain't half-bad , i guess .
what do you think ?
we are the all-singing , all-dancing crap of the world . we are all part of the same compost heap ...
you could give me the gun .
goodnight .
right , yeah - -
okay . so we need a source . where do we start ?
there aren't enough arrows .
what other issue is there , sid ?
sometimes , yes .

really ? because - -
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship . my ... eh ... we kidnapped it . on it there was a map that said how to come to earth . this was very important . before then , we thought we were the only people in all the stars .
what ? how did you know i had a cat ?
hasn't been another call , has there ?
phillip , this is worse than that trip to quebec city when i fell asleep in that disco .
they had us bugged . christ , he had everybody bugged . yeah , he was gonna support me in ' 68 , but he was also threatening me . that was hoover : he'd give you the carrot , but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass .
you know ?
it's fucked - - now will you please tell i . a . that i'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here ?
just his style , morg . doesn't mean anything .
okay , starling . let's have it .
i've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through . he's a cop ?
oooh , baby , you were the best . i was beside myself .

the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you . you thought they were your friends . why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them ?
" my dear " ...
yeah , dad . what the hell is going on ?

what did you do ?
admiration ? my my .
albert ! for christ's sake ... john ! wait a minute , you guys !
dan . and he's taking alice with him - - pretty good dive yvonne . you've been practicing .
what do you think my father would do if i told him i didn't want to be a lawyer anymore ?
there goes mother .
well , who was it that taught me how to do that ? huh ?
i'm afraid not . you see , we observe things that you're unaware of : signs , indicators . your problem cuts very deep , frances , and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out , you'll really feel secure . does that make sense ?
come on , darling - - we're going up to bed .
leaving what ?
really ?
i'm not sure . i've never seen anything like it .
and these ?
take a walk , pal .
oh baby ... i don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves ... but if you all need to eat until your mother's well , all you have to do is say so ... we have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry .
we're the government , cowan .
ok , ok . i'm back .
when do you think we'll be going back , mack ?
what are we looking for ?
i don't know . i'm not sure . he said there are people who want to lose , who are always looking for an excuse to lose .
yes .
look , it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use . i think the light switch is over there - - and that's the radio . it's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf .
i couldn't help it ! it was the most fun i've had since i've been in law school . not only was i good enough for warner - - i was better than him . he has to see serious i am now . even donovan was impressed , and he's a total hard-ass .
they'll probably make a run for the border , which would bring ' em this way . and if we get our hands on those shit asses , we're talking payback time . we'll get ' em all right . i gotta piss . i'm gonna use your commode .
they are primitive , lara , but they are not animals .
sir ?
i'd better get you to a hospital .
i beg your pardon ?
offering it for debate .
harry ... my god ...
i don't see anything .
- - you've done worse than let haldeman slip away , you've got people feeling sorry for him--i didn't think that was possible . a conspiracy like this - - the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck . you build from the outer edges and you go step by step . if you shoot too high and miss , then everybody feels more secure . you've put the investigation back months .
it still strikes me as , well , surreal , that i'm allowed to see you naked .
probably no longer than four weeks .
of course you don't know anything about it . if you knew anything about it , i wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it .
you know , if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him .
the pentagon , wasn't it , general ? only you weren't in that uniform ...
with your mother's pull , how come you're not a chicken colonel by now ?
he can't hurt us , michael . it's us - our love . he can't find a crack in it . he can't find a way in .

i didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself , dignan .
whenever you want it . the money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags , you know ? in a locker at the airport , waiting to be picked up .
her knee acting up ?
i can back him off .
... i'm sure it is , but this is massachusetts , doctor . certified in internal medicine ?
pssst ! hey rose ! there they are !
okay .
maybe he would . we applied for officers ' training together , remember ? they turned me down , but i'm glad to see you made it . of course , it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it ! his mother's got twenty million dollars .

those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money .
you're groping . i have been fair . it's my move now .
we don't tell anyone that . which is why you can talk to us . and if we can't verify what you say someplace else , we don't print it . that's another reason you can relax .
you might say that , although i don't think of it as traveling .
it'll be fine when we get done with it .
too christian . you know jameson ? paul virilio ?

i'm not sad , no , i owe the captain my life . it's just you think you want to help prevent crime , but you realize that's too complicated . it's a lot more fun to punish crime . then after a while , you don't care what's a crime and what's not , what you became a warrior for . you just want the kicks . the rush .

i'm all ears .
